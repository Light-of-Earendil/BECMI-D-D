.. Chapter 14: Monsters
```
" monster;' technically. is any crearure that
```
· not a player character. This chapter de-
```
scri many different types of monsters; these
```
monsters are listed in alphabetical order.
Monsters are not always ravenous beasts that
automatically attack PCs and ferociously fight to
the death . Monsters may be friendly or un-
friendly, wild or tame, normal or bizarre. Some
```
will be random, dangerous encounters; some
```
```
will be long-term c:nc:mies of the: PCs; some will
```
be one:- time: or permanent allies of the: PCs . The:
Monster Reaction Table: from Chapter 7 can be
used to determine how monsters respond to the
PCs at ftrSt if desired .
How to Read Monster
Descriptions
Each enuy on the following pages has a de-
sc ription of the monsters, often including notes
on their behavior. Every monster is described in
```
the: same manner.
```
Monster Name
lf the name of a monster is followed by an as·
```
terisk (*). then a special or magical weapon is
```
needed to hit that monster. The monster's de-
scription tells what sort of weapon is needed. Use
```
these monsters with caution; thc:y are very dan-
```
gerous ro low-level characters who may n ot ha ve:
the right type of weapon to effectively fight such
creatures.
Monster Statistics
Just as the playe r characters have abilities
```
(Strength. Dexterity, ere. ), monsters have statis-
```
tics. Eve ry monster in this chapter has the follow-
ing set of statistics:
Armor Class:
Hi t Dice:
```
Move :
```
```
Anacks:
```
```
Damage:
```
No. Appearing:
Save As:
```
Morale:
```
Treasure Type:
```
lotelligence:
```
```
Alignment:
```
XP Value:
```
Aunor Class (A C)
```
Thu number works just like a character's ar-
mor class: the lower the number, the harder it is
to hit the crearure.
A monster's armor class is detecmined by the
creature's speed and dexterity, the toughness of
```
skin, and armor worn (if any). The OM may ad-
```
just the armor class for special situations. For ex-
ample, a hobgoblin is normally armor class 6
```
(p robab ly wearing leather armor), but may be
```
changed to armor class 2 if the hobgoblin some-
bow finds plate mail armor.
Some Hit Dice numbers are followed by ad-
```
justments (a plus or minus followed by another
```
```
number). For example. "Hit Dice: 3 +! "shows
```
```
the number of Hit Dice (3) and an adjustment
```
```
( + I). The adjustment is the number of hit
```
points added to or s ubtracted from the total of
```
the dice; for instance, with a Hit Dice 3 + I crea-
```
ture, the OM would roll 3d8 and add I to the
total. lfhe rolled 14 on the dice. the creature has
```
I) hit points.
```
```
lf an asterisk (*)appears next to the Hit Dice
```
```
number. the monster bas a special ability (usu-
```
ally either magical spells, a special attack, or a
```
special defense) which will be explained in the
```
creature's description. A creature may have sev-
eral asterisks by its Hit Dice figure, one for each
special abili ty. Special abilities affect the number
of experience points the characters earn for de-
feating the monster, as explained in Chapter 10 .
Beside the Hit Di ce number will be an abbre-
```
viation: (S). (M), or (L) . (S) stands for "S mall"
```
or "Smaller Than Man-Size ," meaning that
these creatures are smaller than most hum ans.
```
(M) means " Medium " or " Man-Size," meaning
```
that they are co mparable in size with humans.
```
(L) means "Large" or "Larger Than Man-Size,"
```
meaning that they are substantially larger than
full-grown humans. Remember that halflings
have a defensive bonus against all creatures of
this size.
```
Move (MV)
```
This gives the movem ent rate for the monster.
Usually, on this line, you ' ll see two numbers,
with the second number in parentheses. The
first number is the number of feet the monster
```
moves in one 10-minute turn; the second num-
```
```
ber is the movement rate per round (for en-
```
```
counters).
```
Some monsters have a second movement rate.
The first is the rate when walking, and the sec-
ond is a special form of movement, such as
swimming, flying, or climbing.
```
Attacks (#AT)
```
This gives the number and type of attacks the
monster can make in one round. Some monsters
have ad ditional special attacks, described later.
```
Damage (Dmg)
```
This line tells you the amount of damage a
monster infliru if its attack succeeds, given as
th e roll of one or more dice. When a monster bas
more than one attack in a round, the attacks and
damages are given in the same order. "By weap-
on" means that the monst er always attacks with
```
a weapon; the damage is determined by the
```
weapon type. A monster using a normal sword
will do normal damage for the normal sword,
plus any damage bonuses listed on this line or in
the monster description.
A typical entry for damage might read " Dam-
```
age: !d6 /2 d6 :' The first attack listed under
```
" Attacks" causes !d6 points of damage and the
second one listed causes 2d6 points of damage.
found outdoors in wilderness. lf either number
is zero, the monster is not normally found in
that location. The OM can always adjust the
number according to the situation.
Dungeon Encounters: The fust No. Appear-
ing figure applies to dungeon encounters. Find
the level of the dungeon upon which the en-
```
counte r occurs. If the monster's level (Hit Di ce)
```
is equal to the level of the dungeon, use the
listed No . App earing. If the monster's level is
```
gre:m:r than the dungeon level, reduce the No .
```
```
Appearing for this encounter (a t least one will
```
```
appear). If the monster's level is less than the
```
dungeon level, then increase the No . Appear-
ing for this encounter. If the creature is encoun-
ter ed in its dungeon lair, the No. Appea ring
can be multip lied by up to five times, but the
OM must use his or her judgment when in-
creasi ng monster numbers to avoid over-
whelming the player cha.racters.
```
Wilderness: The second No. Appearing figure
```
```
(in parenthese s) is used for nondungeon en-
```
counters. If the creatures are found in their wil-
derness lair, the No. Appearing can be
multiplied by up to five rimes as above.
```
In any monster lair (whether in a dungeon or
```
```
wilderness), up to half of the total number
```
present may be young or very old creatures,
sometimes with little or no combat ability. In ad-
```
dition, several adults may be absent (hunting,
```
```
scouting, etc.), depending on the season, time
```
of day, and othe r conditions.
```
Save As (Save)
```
This line shows you the character class and
level at which the monster makes saving throws.
For example, if the description says "Save: F7 ,"
then the monster saves as a 7th level fighter.
```
C: Cleric
```
```
F: Fighter
```
```
M: Magic-User
```
```
T: Thief
```
```
D : Dwarf
```
```
E: Elf
```
```
H: Halfling
```
Refer to the applicable character cl ass descrip-
tion to find the exact saving throws the monster
uses. As a rule of thumb, unintelligent monsters
usually save as fighters of half their monster
level. So me monsters may have special adjust-
ments to some saving throws, as given in their
descriptions.
```
Morale (ML)
```
This optional rule measures the monster's
courage in co mbat. Wh enever a monster needs
```
to make a morale check (see the " Morale" sec-
```
```
tion of Chapter 8) the OM rolls 2d6 against the
```
number shown on thU line. If the result is
greater tha.n the morale score, the monsters try to
run away or surrender. Otherwise, the monsters
continue to fight. lf the monsters are encoun-
tered in their lair or have special leaders, raise
their morale scores by I or 2 points.
```
No. Appearing (NA) Treasure Type (TT)

Chapter 14: Monsters ·.
If a treasure type is given in parentheses. it is
the treasure t:2rried by the monster rather than
found in iu lair. A wandering monster with no
letter in parentheses will have no treasure.
ln telligenee
When a monster is hit by a charm or maze
spell or whenever the OM just needs to know ap·
proximately how bright the creature is , iu Intel-
ligence can be a guideline. This line gives the
aven.ge intelligence for a creature of this type.
The OM can vary the intelligence of individual
monsters, as described later in this chapter.
Monster intelligence scores range from 0 to
18 +. Unthinking creatures such as insectS and
slimes rate an Intelligence score of 0. Common
animals normally have Intelligen ce scores of 2.
```
Some very bright animals (for example, pegasi)
```
have Intelligen ce scores of 4 or 5. well into the
human range. However, note that having scores
of 3 to 5 doesn't mean these creatures think the
way humans do, merely that they often seem
clever in comparison with the stupidest of hu-
man beings.
```
Alignmenr (Al)
```
Monsters may be Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.
Normal animals are Neutral. A good Dungeon
Master always considers alignment when playing
the role of a monster. For example, a Lawful
monster docs not normally have any reason to ar-
rack a party of player characters: even if it is
guarding an area, it will first warn the characters
away. Only intelligent monsters can speak an
alignment language.
```
XP Va lu e (XPV)
```
This line indicares rhc experience poinu to be
awarded for the defeat of one of that rypc: of
monster. However, the OM may give more cxpc·
riencc points for monsters in "tough" encount-
ers, such as 1n attack on a well-defended lair, or
less experience points for encounters where the
monsters never get to bring their abilities into
play. See Chapter 10 for more details on experi-
ence point awards.
Monster Descriptions
Below the monster statistics are paragraphs of
text-the monster's descriprion. Aside from the
main body of the description. there may be sev-
en! special paragraphs including the following:
Monster Type:
```
Terrain:
```
```
Load: (Optional)
```
```
Barding Multiplier: (Optional)
```
the monster can only be harmed by magical
weapons or is magically summoned or con-
```
trolled), and these monsters can be affected by
```
such spells as protection from evil 10' n.dius.
Monster rarity is given in parentheses whether a
creature is "Common," "Rare," or "Very Rare ."
Common creatures will appear frequently in a
```
campaign; rare creatures should appear only occa-
```
```
sionally; and very rare creatures should only show
```
up in extraordinary places or circumstances.
Description
This is a general description of the monster's
habits, appean.ncc, special abilities, and behav-
ior. In the description, you may find any of the
following terms.
```
Carnivore: The creature prefers to eat meat
```
and does not usually cat plants.
```
Herbivore: The creature prefers to eat plantS
```
rather than meat.
```
Insectivore: The creatu re prefers to cat insectS
```
rather than plantS or red meat.
```
Omnivore: The creature will cat nearly any-
```
thing edible.
```
Nocturnal: The creature is normally active at
```
night, sleeping during the day. However,
dungeons are often dark as nigh t, and a noctur·
nal creature may be awake during "daylight
hours" if found within a dark dungeon.
A monster's home is called iu /air. Most mon-
ster lairs arc in dungeon rooms or ouuidc, hid-
den in the wilderness. Most monsters will defend
their lairs fiercely.
Tecnin
This line describes the type of terrain the
monster frequentS. The monster need not be
limited to this type of terrain. Terms used to de-
fine terrain include the following.
```
Cavem: This includes natural caves, deep ftS·
```
sures, grottoes, natural tunnel complexes, and
other underground settings.
Cold/Arctic: These arc areas of snow-capped
mountains, ice-sheets, snow-covered pla.ins, and
tundra.
```
Dcscrr: This terrain includes arid barrens. hot
```
rocky plains. sand seas, and similar areas.
Lost World: This is a special area cut off from
the outside world, where creatures from a by-
gone age live on unchanged, including prehis·
toric areas.
M oUI1t2in: These arc rocky areas, including
cliffs. gorges. mesas, peaks. volcanoes, and so
```
on : it also extends to include hills, rocky barrens,
```
and other very rough and broken ternin .
```
Ocean: Oceans include salt water seas and sur·
```
face and underwater encounters. Coastal en·
counters are specially noted.

This is a general guide as to the type of mon- ing grasslands, plains, savannahs, steppes,scrubland, veldt, and moorlands.
```
stcr this creature is; different types of monsters River/Lake: This includes freshwater encount-have different sets of abilities, as described later
```
er areas, with both surface and underwater en·
ness, where most adventures we place.
Sw.~ mp: This terrain includes swamps. marsh-
es, bogs, and similar low, wet ground.
```
Woods: This terrain is woodland, forests, jun-
```
gles. and similar terrain, including wooded hills.
```
Load (Optiona l)
```
Some monsters can be harnessed to carry
riders or loads of gear. Such monsters are given
an encumbrance total the creature can carry.
Normally. two numbers arc given. The creature
can carry up to the first number without difficul-
```
ty; it can carry up to the second number at no
```
```
more than half iu listed movement rates. (Re-
```
```
minder : 10 en • I pound . )
```
```
Barcling Multiplier (Op tional)
```
Some monsters that carry riders can be fitted
```
with specially craft ed barding (armor for
```
```
mounts) . If they can use barding, that barding
```
normally costs more and weighs more than horse
barding. Choose a type of barding for the mon-
```
ster (see the "A rm or" section of Chapter 4),
```
note itS cost and encumbrance, and then multi-
ply that cost and encumbrance by the number
shown on this line. The results are the cost and
encumbrance of barding for a creature of this
type.
Abbreviated Monster
Listings
In many 0&0® game adventures, you will
find short monster listings. These listings con-
tain most of the information described above
but use abbreviations instead of full-length
terms. vastly compressing the monster informa-
tion.
Here's a typical abbreviated monster listing:
```
Dragon, Pocket: NA 1-6 (2-12); AC 8; HO
```
```
3• ; #AT I bite; Dmg 1-3 + venom; MV 90'

```
Some: entries slightly vary from the format
```
shown above. Some, for instance, will alter the
order in which the statistics appear and may add
other information. Don't be confused by
changes in order or the addition of extra statis-
```
tics: the basic abbreviations arc the same. Some

of the extra abbreviations you'll see in variations

fully and refer to this section whenever special
attacks are used in a game.
Acid
Acid damage is possible from the attacks of
black dragon breath, gray ooze, and other crea·
tures. The amount of damage done by an acid
```
attack is given with the monster description; nor-
```
mal items can be ruined if the victim of the acid
anack fails a saving throw.
Blindness
Certain monster powers, spells, special
actions, or fighting in the dark without infra-
vision can result in blindness. Some forms of
```
blindness do not involve sight; for example, a
```
bat can be "blinded" by the clerical silence IY
radius spell. Sec "Special Character Conditions"
in Chapter 13 for more details.
Charge
If a monster can run toward its opponent for
```
20 yards {20 feet indoors), it inflictS double dam-
```
age if it hits. A monster cannot charge in certain
types of terrain: broken, heavy forest, jungle,
mountain, swamp. etc.
Charm
Some monsters can enchant a character so that
the character believes that the monster is a
friend. If a character is the victim of a charm at·
```
tack (from a harpy, for example) and fails a sav-
```
ing throw vs. spells, the character is immediately
charmed. This special attack works just like the
magic-user charm person spell, except that the
effect ends at once if the monster is killed.
Continuous Damage
Some monsters hold on when they hit their
victims. When this occurs, they need make no
```
further attack rolls; the victim takes a given
```
amount of damage each round, usually until the
monster or iu victim is killed. Constriction and
blood draining are rwo examples of this type of
special attack.
Disease
Unless otherwise noted in the description, dis·
ease requires a saving throw vs . poison. Failure
means the character has a 25% chance of dying
within 1-6 days, and in any event he will need
complete rest for that time . Success means the
character avoids the disease. Disease can be
cured at once by spells such as cure disease .
Energy Drain
poinr of the new level. Against powerful
```
demihumans (those who have advanced beyond
```
```
level limits), the anack drains 101,000·120,000
```
```
experience points ( ld20 x 1,000 + 100,000).
```
A 1st level character hit by an energy drain at-
tack is killed and often rcrurns as an undead un-
der the control of the slayer. If not specified. this
occurs 24-72 hours after death.
Lost experience levels can be regained through
the 7th level clerical spell rescore or by earning
the experience through normal adventuring.
A monster hit by energy drain would lose one
Hit Die from this effect, with loss of hit pointS
and possible reduction of arrack rolls and saving
throws.
In general, a monster with the energy drain
ability must make a conscious attack with it for
the power to take effect. In other worcls, a vam·
pire could pick up and carry a human without
harming him or her, if the vampire wished to do
```
so; likewise, a mystic could anack a vampire with
```
his bare hands and not lose experience levels just
from hitting the vampire.
Paralysis
This effect "freezes" a character. If a character
is hit by a paralyzing anack and fails the saving
throw vs . paralysis. the character is unable to do
```
anything (see Chapter 13, under "Special Char·
```
```
acter Conditions") .
```
Petrification
This is a dangerous ability of certain fantastic
monsters. It may take the form of a gaze, breath,
or normal hit in combat, as given in the monster
description. When hit by a peuification attack,
the victim must make a saving throw vs. turn to
stone . A victim who fails the saving throw turns
into a stone statue. All equipment carried,
whether normal or magical, turns to stone with
him, becoming part of the statue and not remov-
able. Certain magical spells can restore a peui-
ficd victim to normal.
Poison
Monster poison is simple and dangerous. A
character hit by poison who fails his saving throw
```
vs . poison dies; if he makes his saving throw , he
```
is unaffected. Optionally, poison may inflict
damage- for example, ld6 per Hit Die of the
creature, with a save for half damage.
Spell Ability
This means a monster can c2.st one or more
spells. Unless otherwise specified, the monster
actS 2.5 a spellc2.ster of level equal to itS own Hit
```
Dice. Usually me ability is innate (that is, the
```
monster does not require speiJ books or time to
```
memorize or meditate) and will be limited to a
```
This is a dangerous anack form. with no sav- certain number of times per day. "At will"
ing throw allowed. If a character i.s hit by an en- means the monster can use the ability every
```
ergy drain attack {by a wight, for example), the round if desired. Some monster spellc2.sters act
```

```
ticularly n2.sty energy-drainers (such as vam- called wokani and shamans, are detailed in the
```
```
pires), the character will lose rwo levels of "Monster SpeiJcasters" section (page 215). A

```
spells, and so forth) as soon as It occurs. The v1c- cast 3rd level spells will have rwo asterisks for
```
Swallow
Some monsters are large enough to swallow a
victim whole. This attack always succeeds if the
anack roll is 20 and might succeed with a lower
```
number (given in the description). The swal-
```
lowed victim takes a given amount of damage
each round until the monster or the victim is
killed. If the victim has an edged weapon, he
may arrack the monster from inside, but with a
-4 penalty on attack rolls. The inside of any
creature is AC 7 unless noted otherwise. Being
swallowed often has effects other than damage
```
(loss of consciousness, paralysis, etc.). If the vic·
```
tim dies, the body is completely digested in one
```
hour {six turns) and cannot be recovered.
```
Swoop
This attack is similar to a charge, but is per-
formed by flying monsters. Unlike the charge,
the swoop only does double damage if the mon·
ster surprises iu opponent . If the artack roiJ is 18
or more and the monster has talons or some way
to grab prey, the monster holds on and tries to fly
away with itS victim. If the victim is too heavy.
the monster lets go immediately. A swoop can-
not be used in dense forest or jungle cover.
Trample
Some monsters try to use their la.rge size to
crush their opponents. When trampling, a mon-
ster gains a + 4 bonus to its attack roiJ if the vic·
tim is man-sized or smaHer. Some groups of
```
animals (herds) may also trample, usually inflict-
```
ing ld20 points of damage through sheer num-
ber rather than large size.
Special Defenses
In addition to good armor classes, high Hit
Dice totals, and special attacks, some monsters
have the additional special defenses of immunity
to normal weapons and speiJ immunity.
Immunity to Normal
Weapons
Many enchanted monsters arc com pletely im-
```
mune to the effects of normal (i.e., nonmagicaJ)
```
weapons. These creatures are especially danger·
ous to low-level characters who are less likely to
have magical weapons available. Some of these
```
crearures (lycanthropes, for example) are vulner-
```
able to silver weapons, while others are even im-
mune to some magical weapons. For instance,
some monsters are immune to normal weapons
and weapons of up to a + I magical bonus, a + 2
bonus, or more. The greater the immunity, the
more dangerous the monster is. Monsters with
```
these immunities have an asterisk (*) beside
```
their name in the monster listing.
tim's experience point total drops to the mid- that ability.

Chapter 14: Monsters ·
Spell Immunity
This special defense may take many forms.
Undead are immune to all forms of charm
```
slcef!. and hold spells; many fire-using creature~
```
arc 1mmun e to fire-rype spells. Some powerful
creatures may be immune to spells of low power,
su e ~ :U all ~st and _2nd level spells. possibly in
addlllon to 1mmumty to a specific type of spell.
When sp~ll immunity is mentioned, it applies to
all spell-like effectS as well, including those pro-
duce? by monsters or devices. For example, im-
mumty to all 1st- 3rd level speiJs also confers
```
immunity to fireballs from a wand or staff (since
```
```
fireball is a 3rd level spell).
```
However. dragon breath is a natural ability of
dragons, not a magical one, and is not affected
unless a description mentions it specifically.
Monster Type
Each monster description has a line for "Mon-
ster Type." Here, these general categories of
monster are described in greater detail. Thecate-
gories include:
```
• Normal Animal (plus Giant Animal and
```
```
Prehistoric Animal)
```
```
• Construct (Enchanted Monster)
```
```
• Dragon (and Dragon-Kin)
```
```
• Humanoid (plus Human , Dcmihuman,
```
```
and Giant Humanoid)
```
• Lowlife
• Monster
• Planar Monster
• Undead
Sometimes a monster will belong to more
than one of these categories.
```
Normal Animal (Giant
```
```
Animal, Prehistoric Animal)
```
A normal ani mal is any sort of nonmagi cal
creature that belongs in itS environment. If a
game "monster" is an animal that occurs in the
real world or is a variant breed of such an animal
```
it is a "normal animal." A normal animal ma;
```
be something as inoffensive as a field-mouse or
as dangerous as a tiger.
A giant animal is simply an oversized version
of a normal animal. It is not magi cal and does
not differ in attack forms or behavior from itS
```
smaller counterpan; it is simply more dangerous
```
because it is much larger.
A prehistoric animal is a creature that was
once a normal animal in the past but has become
```
extinct on our world; such creatures as sabre-

```
greater constructs include gargoyles and go-
lems. The following general rules apply to all
```
constructs:
```
1. They can b_e created only if the proper magi-
cal process IS used. Rules for their creation are
given in Chapter 16.
2. They do not heal normally; magic must be
used to cure them of any damage incurred.
3. T?ey are immune to the cffens of poison
```
(smce they are not truly alive) and mental ef-
```
```
fectS (charm. sleep. illusions. etc.).
```
4. They do not reproduce; there arc never "ba-
by gargoyles:· for example.
```
Dragon (Dragon-Kin)
```
The dragons are among the fiercest and most
d~ngerous of monsters. They are huge reptiles
With great Wings. cruel teeth, sharp claws, and a
keen awareness of their own superiority. Most
```
have "breath weapons" (i .e .. attacks where they
```
```
breath out a damaging effect such as fire). many
```
arc of great intelligence, and some can cast
```
spells. Not all dragons arc evil ; some are very
```
good, benevolent creatures.
There are also dragon-kin, species related to
dragons. such as chimerae, drakes. dragon tur-
tles. hydras, salamanders. and wyverns.
```
Humanoid (Giant Humanoid
```
```
Demihuman, Human) '
```
A humanoid creatur,e is roughly human in
```
shape (two arms, two legs. biped) but is not hu-
```
man or demihuman. Lowly monsters such as
goblins fall in this category, as do creatures up to
ogre size . Humanoids are subject to the charm
person spell.
A giant humanoid is Like a normal humanoid
on ly larger and more powerful. These includ~
true giantS and creatures such as trolls. These
crearures are not subject to the charm person
spell.
A demihuman is a member of a nonhuman
character class: a dwarf, elf, or halfling.
Finally, _humans can be encountered nearly
anywhere-~~ a game world . They provide many
opponumues for role -playing by both the OM
and the players. In addition. they can be used to
provide goals for the player characters and can
lead to entire adventures. In some cases, the rea-
~ns for the encounter may cause some changes
Ill nearby rooms ?f the dungeon. For example, if
the NPCs arc acung as bait, the OM may wish tO
place a harpy in a nearby cmpry room or to
change a given monster to a harpy.
Smce humans tend to be individuals, an en·
counter with humans w,ill require some work by
th~ ~M. but the encounter ca n be quite enter-
tammg. The NPC humans do not need to be as
detailed as player characters. The OM may create
each human NPC character in full detail or may
use the Type of Human Checklist 10 find the
```
necessary details. (Note: This same procedure
```
can be used for demihumans by omitting step

known to be in the dungeon.
6. Not What They Seem: The NPCs arc not
mere humans. They may be lycanthropes,
dopplegangers, gold dragons, etc. The
OM shou ld determine the monster type
and run the monsters normally.
7. Running Away: The NPCs are running
away from an encounter with a nearby
monster. The monster may be chasing
them.
8. Sole _Survivors: The NPCs are the only
surv1vors of a recent battle with monsters.
The remains of the rest of their party may
be found 1n a nearby monster lair.
_A construct .is a monster that is not actually

·'Chapter 14: Monsters
Lowlife
The lowlife creatures are, for the most pan,
```
nonintelligem (Intelligence 0) and have simple
```
lifestyles. Most are plants, fungi, insecrs, arach-
nids, slimes, oozes, or other invenebrates such as
worms or slugs. The category also includes speci-
mens of huge size.
Monster
A monst er is any creature that does not fit into
one of the other categories. They tend to be leg-
endary or fabulous creatures, but otherwise may
have little in common with each other. Some re-
```
semble members of other groups (humanoids or
```
```
animals, for example) but have abilities or
```
powers that set them a pan.
```
Planar Monster (Enchanted
```
```
Monster)
```
All pl anar monsters have one thing in com-
```
mon: they come from a plane of existence other
```
```
than the Prime Plane (the dimension that is the
```
```
player characters' home). Some monsters will
```
have both Prime Plane and other planar ver-
```
sions; these will be noted. Plana.r monsters that
```
are summoned or gated to the Prime Plane are
"enchanted" monsters as well.
Most other-plana.r creatures do not have "nor-
mal" treasures but may have the equivalent in
the material of their own planes. For example,
valuable gems on the elemental plane of Water
may appear as bits of colored ice. When the trea-
sure type given is "Special," the OM may change
the treasures to match the plane.
Undead
The und ead are creatures that were once alive
but now owe their existence to powerful super-
natural or magical forces upon their spirirs or
bodies. Most undead can be repelled by clerics or
cenain objecrs, such as holy symbols. Undead
are not affected by special attacks that affect only
```
living creatures (such as poison) or by spells that
```
```
affect the mind (sleep, charm, hold, discord, in-
```
```
sanity. fccblcmind, ere.). Undead created by
```
magical spells are "enchanted" monsters.
Monster Frequency
Monsters arc listed as being common, rare, or
very rare. Rare monsters should be used less fre-
quently than common monsters. Very rare mon-
sters should usually appear in carefully planned
encounters or in seldom-visited settings.
Monster List
This is the basic list of monsters for the D&D*
game. Other monsters are introduced in adven-
tures and supplements published for the game.

```
This solitary creature is a protector of wood-
land creatures. The actaeon is 9' tal l, with the
arms, torso, and facial features of a human but
```
the antlers and lower legs of an elk; itS whole
```
body is covered with brown elklike rude.
```
It can camouflage itSelf perfectly (as if invisi-
```
```
ble) in light or dense woods. When angered by
```
```
the wanton slaying of wooclland creatures (or
```
```
similar vile acrs), the actaeon springs out of hid-
```
```
ing, usually with surprise {1·5 on ld6). It often
```
uses large wood and bone spears to punish or slay
rhe defilers of the woods.
It has a powerful breath weapon that can be
```
used once per day, filling a 10' X 10' X 10' cube;
```
each victim within it must make a saving throw
vs. dragon breath or be polymorphcd into a nor-
```
mal forest creature (owl, squirrel, deer, etc.). lf
```
the saving throw is successful, the uartSforma-
rion srill occurs, but lasrs for only 24 hours.

Actaeons are members of the woodland com-
munity along with centaurs, dryads, etc. They
are sufficiently bold and rare that they are re-
nowned heroes of these forest folk . Actaeon
sometimes work with druids to preserve the
safety of the woods, especially if a dangerous
threat is involved.

Monscer Type: Monster (Very Rare).
```
Adaptors are a peculiar race native to all
planes of existence. They are very intelligent,
and their ancient race has greater and wider
knowledge than any sage, but their cultural phi-
losophy demands that they not pass their great
knowledge between planes and human cultures.
Instead, they uavcl and observe civilization
throughout the planes, exchanging information
only among themselves.
```
Adaptors arc natural (nonmagical) poly-
```
mor phs, able to change into the form of any
creature of human or demihuman size. They al-
so change color after they adapt co an attack.
They are uavelcrs, rarely staying anywhere for
more than three days, and able to enter and
leave other planes at will.
These creatures have the ability to adapt-to
alter their physical suucrure to survive in any en-
vironment. Once exposed to any type of magical
```
attack, they then become immune to it; for ex-
```
ample, a Jighcning bolt would inflict full or half
damage when first used against it, but all elecui-
cal attacks would thereafter have no effect. The
adaptation fades away in ldiO rums if not used.
```
In combat, adaptors are skilled at swordplay (2
```
attacks per round, +4 bonus to attack and damage
```
rolls). If the OM wishes, he can have an adaptor
```
protect itself with fanrascic devices which the PCs
```
cannot comprehend or use (if desired, designed by
```
```
the OM). Examples might include a flame rube,
```
uance inducer, or energy neutralizer.
```
Adaptors are not the same as dopplegangers;
```
they cannot rum into duplicates of specific people.

are known by a name which sounds like
"haoou." They are only encountered on the
```
Prime Plane when conjured by a cleric (see the
```
```
clerical spell aerial servant). They don't care to
```
```
be summoned for this slave labor; they do not
```
deliberately or maliciously misinterpret their
summoners' orders, but they are hateful ene-
mies of humans who visit the plane of Air.
Clerics can summon aerial servants to perform
tasks for them. Summoned aerial servants will
```
not fight; they only accept orders to seize things
```
or prisoners and bring them back co the cleric.
They can only be harmed by spells or magical
weapons. They travel at super-speed, often sur-
```
prising their prey (I-7 on IdS). The percentage
```
chance of breaking free of the servant's grip is
equal to the victim's Hit Dice or experience level
```
(i.e., an 18th level fighter has an 18% chance to
```
```
break free of the grip).
```

ry their kills back to the nest. Once engaged in
combat, they will fight to the death, even trying to
cross flames to reach their opponents.
A giam ant nest looks like a large. bare hill.
Giant ant nests are not as heavily populated as
those of smaller ants. At any given rime, the nest
will be protected by 4d6 giant ants, and another
10d6 will be on the trails, gathering food. There
is an ant queen in the deep, well-guarded egg
chamber of the ant nest.
Giant ants behave just like their smaller cous-
ins. They wander all over the landscape, finding
```
sources of ready food (grain warehous es,
```

watering-holes, villages), communicate their
```
frnds to the nest, and set up a uail from the nest
to the food and back.

vores but prefer meat. They are not inclined to
eat humans, preferring small herd animals when
they can catch such beastS. They do not make
tools or weapons but wiU pick up bones or
branches to use as clubs.
Rock baboons form packs of up to 30 mem-
bers, each pack led by a dominant male. They
are ferocious and have vicious tempers. They do
not speak a true langu age, but use simple
screams to communicate warnings and needs.
Rock baboons will not go out of their way to
attack travelers, but will try to scare intruders out
of their hunting grounds.

A basilisk is a 10'-long lizard; it looks mu ch
```
lik e: a large: snake with four legs and a crownlike
growth on its head . It may be of any color, but is
usually very bright and di stin ctive. It is some-
times called the " king of snakes."
The basilisk is a nonintelligent bu t very magi-
cal lizard. It lives in underground caverns or wild
and tangled thi ckets. Any creature hit by a basi-
lisk must m ake a saving throw vs. turn to stone or
```
be petrified; all equipment he carries will also be
```
rurned to stone. The basilisk's gaze has the same
```
effect; anyone m ee ting the gaze must m ake the
```
same saving throw or be petrified. A surprised
```
character automatical ly meets the gaze (but gets
```
```
the saving throw).
```
A characrer in hand-to-hand co mbat with the
creature must either avoid the gaze or meet the
gaze each round. When a character tries to avoid
the gaze, he suffers a - 4 pena lty to a ll attack
rolls against the monste r, while the basilisk gains
a + 2 bonus to all its a tt acks against the charac-
ter. If the character meets the gaze, he attacks
and defends normally but must make the saving
throw at his normal odds.
A character may use a mirror when confront-
ing a basilisk. While using a mirror, he suffers a
- 2 penalty to the attack roll (instead of -4).
The area must be lit for the mirror to be effective
and the attacker cannot use a shield. If the basi-
```
lisk sees irsclf in the mirror (a roll of 1 on ld6,
```
```
check ed each ro und ), it must make a saving
```
throw or be turned to stone!
Basilisks are native to both the Prime Plane
and the elemental plane of Earth.
Plane of Earth: On the plane of Earth, a basi-
li sk is merely a Lizardlike creature made: of rock.

Bears are well known to all adventurers. lf any
bear hits one vicd m with both paws in one
round, the bear hugs its victim and inAicts 2d8
points of additiona l damage in that same round.
Black Bear: Black bears have black fur and
stand about 6' ta ll. They arc omnivores but pre-
fer roots and berries. A black bear will not usu-
ally attack un less it is cornered and ca nnot
escape. Adult black bears will fight to the death
to protect their young. They have been kn own to
raid camps, seeking food. They are especially
fond of such treats as fresh fish and sweets.
Grizzly Bear: Grizz ly bears have silver-tipped
brown or reddish brown fu r and stand about 9'
tall. They arc fond of meat and are much more
likely to attack than black bears. Grizzlies arc
found in most climates, but arc most common in
mountains and forests.
Pola r Bear: Polar bears have white fur and
stand about 11 ' tall. They live in cold regions.
They usually eat fish, but often attack adventur-
ers. The se huge bears are good swimmers, and
their wide f eet allow them to run across snow
without s inking .
Cave Bear: These enormous bears stand about
I 5' tall. They do not sec well at all but hunt very
well by scent. If hungry, they will follow a track
of blood until they have eaten. They prefer a di-
et of fresh-kill ed red m eat and live in caves,
mostly in prehistoric envi.ronmcnrs or very dis-
tant mountain areas where human civilization
has n ot penetrated .

A beholder, also called an "eye tyrant" or
"s phere of many eyes," looks like a large float ing
```
ball (about 4' in diameter) covered with tough
```
armor-plated skin. Atop the beholder are ten
small eyes on stalks, each with its own magi ca l
power. A large central eye is on rhe front of the
body. with a toothy mouth below it.
A beholder moves by means of a slow flight
that cannot be dispelled. It speaks most lan-
guages and is extremely intelligent, cruel, and
greedy. It is normally found alone but is rarely
```
()% chance) found wi th ld6 young (each with1
```
/•o normal Hit Dice and range of eye effects,

```
The beholder's fr ont eye always projects an
anti-magic ray, which temporarily "tu rns off" all
```
magic within 60' in front of it (see" Anti-Magic"
```
```
in C hapter 13). Magical weapons used within
```
t he ray are treated as if nonmagical. Spells cast
```
within 1t area of effect are instantl y ruined; spells
```
cast from further away are ruined when the ef.
fccts get within range. The beholder will usually
turn to face any cha.racter who starts casting, ru-
ining the spell.
Magi cal weapons and items will work normal-
ly on ce they are removed from the anti-magic ray
area, and existing spell effects with durations
will resume once the ray is directed elsewhere.
This ray cannot be aimed above or below the
creature, but only straight out in front of it. As
this ray can affect any magic, even that of the
```
smaller eyes (as explained below), the small eyes
```
cannot be used on targets within the anti-mag ic
ray.
If a character uses a weapon to attack a be-
holder, the player must dedare wh at his cha.rac-
ter is aiming at-the body, the large eye. or an
eye stalk. Each target has a different armor class
and hn points as follows:
```
• The body is AC 0 and has )0 hit points.
```
• The front eye is AC 2 and has 20 hit points.
• An eye stalk is only AC 7. but c~n with·

does not count toward killing the creature .

against an eyestalk is successful, the OM should
roll randomly to see which stalk is damaged. A

damage to eyest~lks regenerates at th e rate of I

Monster Type: Undead Construct, Enchanted
```
(Very Rare).
```
An undead beholder is similar to a living one,
but is a construct created for some specific evil
```
purpose. AU undead beholders are constructS;
```
" real" beholders never become undead .
This monster looks quire similar to a normal
beholder-a large floadng ball, about four feet
in diameter, covered with tough armor-plated
skin. Atop the monster arc ten small eyes on
stalks, each with its own magical power. A large
ccnual eye is on the front of the body, with a
toothy mouth below .it. The creature moves
```
about by magical flight, a natural (non magical)
```
ability. It is extremely intelligent, and speaks
many languages. Any cleric of 25th level or
greater will recognize the creature as undead
when he sees it.
An undead beholder cannot be harmed by
```
normal, silver, or even +I magical weapons; a
```
magical weapon of + 2 or better enchantment is
needed to damage it. It is immune to all charm,
hold, and sleep effects, all illusions. death rays,
and poison.
The monster's body regenerates 3 hit points
per round as soon as it is damaged. If reduced to
0 hit points, it is forced into gaseous form and
```
cannot regenerate; it mus t rest for 1 hour in total
```
darkness before the regeneration stans once
again. The monster usually keeps several areas of
continual darkness near its location.
An undead beholder can assume gaseous form
at will. ln this form, it has no special abilities,
but cannot be harmed except by magic that af-
fects air. The monster cannot use any special
abilities during that round of combat in which it
is becoming or leaving its gaseous form.
Chapter 14: Monsters ·
Its bite inflicts 2d 10 points of damag e and al-
```
so causes an energy drain of two levels (as a
```
```
vampire's).
```
The monster's front eye always projectS a ray
of reflection. Any spell cast at the monster from
this direction is reflected back at the caster. In
addition, any attempts to turn undead from in
front is also reflected back on the cleric, who
mu st make a saving throw vs. spells or run in fear
for 2d6 rounds. The monster usually rurns to
face any character who starrs casting a spell, and
watches for clerics. This reflection ca nnot be
aimed above or behind the crearure, bu t only
suaight in front of it.
lf a character uses a weapon to attack an un-
dead beholder, the player must declare what the
character is aiming at -th e body, the large eye,
or an eye stalk. Each target has a different armor
class and hit points as follows:
• The body is AC -4 , and can rake 90 hit
points of damage before the beholder is
killed.
• The front eye is AC -2 , and has 30 points.
• An eye stalk is only AC 3. but each can
withstand 20 pointS of damage. Damage to
the eye stalks does not count toward killing
the creature.
Small eyes and eyesralks: Each small eye may
be used once per round at most, and only three
```
eyes can aim in one direction (forward , back-
```
```
ward, etc.; if a target is above the creature, all
```
```
ten small eyes can be used). The beholder often
```
uses only two small eyes per round unless se ri -
ously threatened .
A "slain" eye is cur off, but a damaged eye
functions normaiJy. Damaged and lost eyes grow
back in ld4 +I hours and do nor regenerate as
fast as the body of the monster.

Berserkers are fighters who go mad in battle.
Most belong to barb:uian cultures-typically,
northern seagoing cultures.
Berserker reactions are determined normally
outside of combat, but once a battle starts they
will always fight to th e death -so metimes at-
tacking their comrades in their blind rage. When
```
fighting humans or humanlike creatures (s uch as
```
```
kobolds, goblins or orcs), they add + 2 to th eir
```

This unusual creature is a small, brown-furred,
rugged-looking cartine with big jaws. It is not,
however, a normal animal. It is intelligent, often
travels in packs , and uses a limited teleponarion
ability. It can "blink out" of one spot and imme-
```
diately appear ("blink in") at another. It has in-
```
scincts that prevent it from appearing in a solid
object.
When attacking, it "blinks" dose to an ene-
my. attacks, and then reappears ld4 x 10' away.
If seriously threatened , an entire pack will
"b link" out and not reappear.
Though as intelligent as many humans, blink
dogs do not speak human or demihuman lan·
```
guages; they can communicate only among
```
themselves. They like to live free the way wolves
do and tend to come in conflict with huma.ns on-
ly when settlers encroach on their territories.
They are carnivores, living on wild elk, moose,
and other herd-beasts.
Blink dogs also hate and attack displacer
beasts, their natural enemies. It is suspected that
blink dogs and displacer beastS both come from
some distant plane of existence.

and arc often found in dungeons or on the boles
and branches of trees in deep forest. They do not
commonly attack travelers, but will usually at-
tack someone who disrurbs them .
They attack by biting. The bite docs no dam-
age to characters, but the victim must make a
saving throw vs. poison or become vi olently ill
for 10 days. Characters who do not make their
saving throws move at half speed and will not be
able to perform any other physical action. The
bite is more effective against very small crea-

creatures must save vs . poison or die.

Awkward on land, crocodiles do not stray far
from water and will spend hours floating just un-
der the surface. At such times, they can be mis-
taken for logs .
If hungry, these animals will arrack creatures in
the water. They arc particularly attraCted to the
smell of blood or violent thrashing of the water.
Normal crocodiles grow to 10' or more in
length. Large crocodiles are about 20 ' long and
can overturn canoes and small rafts. Giant croco-
diles are almost always found in "lost worlds"
where prehistoric creatures thrive. They are over
```
)0' long and have been known to attack small

ships.

A cyclops (plural: cyclopes) is a rare rype of gi-
```
ant, noted for its great size and the single eye in
the center of its forehead. A cyclops is about 20'
tall. It has poor depth perception because of its
single eye. and it srrikes with a penalty of - 2 on
all arrack rolls. A cyclops will usually fight with a
wooden club. It can throw rocks to a 200' range
```
(60 / 130/200), each hit causing 3d6 points of
```
damage.
```
Some cyclopes (~%) are able to cast a curse
```
```
once a week . (The OM should decide the exact
```
```
nature of the curse.)
```
A cyclo ps usually Lives alone, though a small
group may so metimes share a large cave. They
spend their time raising sheep and grapes.
Cyclopes are known for their stupidity, and a
clever party can often escape from them by
trickery.

Most aquatic dinosaurs are fish, turtles, or a
combination of the two. Most are omnivorous,
eating marine plants and a few small fish or oth-

large aquatic: Some large land herbivores
have marine counterparts. similar in appearance
except for smaller legs, and fins instead of claws .
Some look like snakes with unarmored turtlelike
bodies. Only the largest aquatic dinosaurs have

Djinn are highly magical in nature, and can
only be harmed by magic or magical weapons. A
djinn can use each of its seven powers three times
each day. These powers are:
```
• Cre~tc Food an d drink (as a 7th level cleric).

tating, it attacks that person , intending to kill
him and assume his identity. Its favorite trick is
to ki ll the otiginal person in some way without
alerting the party. Then, in the role of that indi-
vidual, it attacks others by surprise, often when
they arc already engaged in combat.
Sleep and charm spells do not affect dopple-
gangcrs and they mak e all saving throws as 8th
level fighte rs due to their highly magical nature.
When killed. a dopplcganger turns back into its
original form, a skinny, hairless, genderless hu-
man oid with pale, rubbery skin.
It is believed the dopplcgangcr establishes a

Dragons are a very old race of huge wmged ltz-
ards. They like to live in isolated. out-of-the-way
places where few men are found . Dragons are ex-
tremely powerful monsters and should be used
with caution when encountered by low level
player ch:uacters. h is recommended that until
characters reach 4th level and hjgher that only
the youngest and smallest dragons be used.

have breath weapons. Dragons have a great love

Subduing Dragons
Whenever characters encounter a dragon,
they may choose totrytosubdue it rather than
kill it.Tosubdue a dragon,aUanacks must be
with the"flatofthe sword." Thus, missile weap-
ons and spells cannot be used to subdue. Attacks
and dam.age are determined normally,butthis
"subduing damage" is not real damage. The
dragon will fight normally until it reaches 0 or
lesshit points,atwhich time it will su.rrender.
The subduing damage does not reduce the dam-
age donebythe dragon's breath weapon.
A dragon may be subdued because it realizes
that its attackers couldhave killed itifthey had
been striking to kill.Ittherefore surrenders, ad-
mining that the opponents have won the battle.
A subdued dragon will anempt toescapeor
turn on its captorifgiven a reasonable chance to
do so through the parry's actions. For example, a
dragon left unguarded at night, or whoisor-
deredtoguard a position alone, would conside.r
these " reasonable chances." A subdued dragon
can be sold. The priceisupto the OM,but
should never exceed 1,000gpperhitpoint.
The dragon may be forced to serve the charac-
ters who subdued it.Ifa subdued dragon is ever
orderedtoperform a task whichisapparently su-
icidal, the dragon will attempttoescape, and
maytrytokill its captors intheprocess.

of twelve dragons: four gold, four amber, and
four blue, al l sufficiently dedicated to serving
the Great One that they do nor get into fights
based on alignment differences. All of these at-
tendants can usc spells.
When uaveling, the dragon rulers usually

```

```
poinrs), one sapphire dragon (144 hit points), and
```
```
one ctystal dragon (96 rut points), in addition to
```
```
the usual four gold dragons (176 hit points each).
```
All dragon rulers arc immune to charm, hold,
paralysis. slow, death ray. disincegrarion. and
poison. Dragon rulers cannot be subdued or
tamed like some lesser dragons,
The three lesser rulers are immune to normal
and silvered weapons, to all spells of 6th level or
less, and to all weapons ofless than + 3 enchant -
ment . The Grear One is immune to normal and
silvered weapons, clerical / druidic spells of 6th
level or less and magical spells of 8th level or less,
and weapons of less than + 4 enchantment.
All dragon rulers are immune to all dragon
breath weapons and are unaffected by dragon
conuol magical items.
A dragon ruler can polymorph itself at will in-
to the form of any of its follower dragons. Each
ruler has a spell book containing all of the
known spells, but must study and learn them
just as a normal magic-user. Clerical spells are
gained with the usual amount of meditation.
Each dragon ruler can use any breath weapon
of its followers, each once per day, and while in
```
either normal or polyrnorphed {to a lesser drag-
```
```
on) form. For example, Opal can breathe a cone
```
```
of cold (as a white), line of acid-and-darkness (as
```
```
an onyx), cloud of gas-and-disease (as a jade), o r
```
```
a lightning bolt (as a blue), for a total of four
```
breaths per day. Each dragon ruler can attack up
```
to rune times per round (with twO bites, twO
```
```
claws, two wings, two kicks , and two tail).
```
```
------Spells By Level (Both C and MU) ------
```
The Great One can usc any breath weapon of
any dragon, each once pe r day, and while in ei-
ther normal or polyrnorphed form . He has up to
10 anacks, using the tail twice.
The lair ucasures of the dragon rulers always

Conjured Elemencals arc s ummoned by the

To summon an elemental, a character must
```
have a large amount of the element nearby (such
```
as open air, bare earth, a pool of water or a bon-
```
fire). When the elcmemal arrives, it is hostile.
```
and must be controlled by concentration at all
times. The summoner's concentration is broken
if he takes damage or fails any saving throw. The
summoner can move only up ro half normal

The statistics above apply on ly to elcmeotals
encountered on their own planes of existence.
On the Prime Plane, their abilities arc very lim-
```
ited. One asterisk (for XP calculation) applies
```
only to eJcmcntals encountered on their own
planes.
Elemcntals are the dominant life forms on the
elemental planes, and refer to themselves as
"people." Size may range from I to 32 Hit Dice,
```
and the rulers are much larger (50 Hit Dice at
```
```
least, and possibly over 100).
```
Their system of rule is similar to that of hu-
man Dominions.
An elemental's normal form is a bloblikc
shape. It can create "arms" as needed, to a max-
imum of 1 per Hit Die, but can only arrack with
one blow per round . The elemental's material
form is held togeth~r by its life force. The youn-
ger the elemental, the less material it can hold
together. Thus, aging effects can change an ele-
mental's size. Its normal life span is 30 10 35 Hit
Dice.
Small elementa.ls are created when a large ele-
mental splits itself. When this occurs, the "par·
ent" elemental divides into a number of parts
```
equal to its Hit Dice; each new elemental has I
```
Hit Die. This does not occur frequently, and the
elemcntals are very secretive about the details of
the process.
Elementals usually distrust creatures from the
```
Prime Plane (-I penalty to all reaction rolls).
```
They can recognize such visitors by smell. How-
ever, when visitors appear in elemental form ,
```
they do appreciate the cffon ( + I bonus to rcac·
```
```
tion rolls, instead of -1 penalty). In any event,
```
they will not normally attack nor help visitors ex-
cept in special circumstances. Though most arc
```
of Neutral alignment, Lawful (ruling) and Cha-
```
```
otic (renegade) elcmcntals do exist. Some are
```
even good or evil.
Elementals live in towns and cities on their
own worlds. Both the worlds and the building
mate rials are made entirely of pure elememal
mate rial, in solid, liquid, or gaseous form . In the
universe of its own plane, each elemental race
occupies thousands of worlds.
The elemental races arc far older than human-
kind, and more civilized in many ways. They
have art forms for six senses.
Some elcmcntals become cleri cs or magic-
users in much the same ways as humans . How-
ever, an elemental mUst be an adult of 9 or more
Hit Dice before this knowledge can be learned.
Many of the spells of the elememals are entirely
different, and some cannot be cast by humans
except when in elemental form .

These slow, huge creatures are identical to
normal elcmentals, but far larger. They arc 2'
tall per Hit Die. The number appearing applies
per plane. Elemental rulers arc immune to 1st
through 5th level spells, poison, all charm, hold,
and other mental attacks, illusions of all types,
and any spell which could cause instant death
```
(such as disinregrace) . Weapons of + 3 or less en-
```
c hantmcnt have no effect on them .
Any victim hit by an elemental ruler mUst
make a saving throw vs . death ray or be crushed
by the blow, instantly slain regardless of dam-
age. Most of the victim's items and equipment
```
are also destroyed by the blow (95% chance per
```
```
item, -5% per "plus" if magical). However,
```
any elemental struck by a ruler is not slain, but
shattered into severa.l small elementals of 1 Hit
```
Die each (the number of parts equal to half the
```
```
original Hit Dice).
```
All elemental rulers are friendly with and can
su mmon most creatures of their respective
planes. The creatures summoned will arrive as
```
quickly as possible (usually from 3 rounds to 3
```
```
turns).
```
The "Special" treasures of elemental rulers
arc similar to those of human rulers, but unique
to their respective planes.

Elephants a.re large, ponderous four-legged
mammals. Though they are herbivores, they a.rc
very dangerous creatures when frightened or
when defending their young. These mighty crea-
rurcs dwell at the edges of sub-tropical forests ,
living in medium to large herds. Both males and
females have rusks. which arc valued at 100·600
gp per rusk for the ivory.
ln combat, elephants attack with a charge, if
possible, for double tusk damage. In the follow-
ing rounds of combat they will either suike with
```
their rusks (n%) or trample (25%). Elephants
```
can be used as draft and riding animals. Some·

Gnomes are a humanoid ra.ce related to (but

```
and have long noses and full beards. Gnomes
have well-developed infravision , with a 90'
range. They usually live in burrows in the low-
lands or in underground communities.
Gnomes are excellent smiths and miners.
They love gold and gems and have been known
to take foolish risks just to obtain them. They
love machinery of all kinds and prefer crossbows
and war hammers as weapons. Gnomes like most
dwarves, but make war with goblins and ko-
bolds, who steal their p recious gold . They usu-
aJly attack kobolds on sight.
For every 20 gnomes, one will be a leader with
II hit points who fights as a 2 Hit Die monster.
In the gnome city or village lives a dan chieftain
and his ld 6 bodyguards. The dan chieftain has
18 hit points, attacks as a 4 Hit Die monster, and
gains a bonus of + I on damage rolls. The body·
guards have 10·13 hit points and attack as 3 HD
monsters. As long as the clan chieftain or leader
is alive, aJl gnomes within sight of him have a
morale of 10 rather than 8.

They have pointed ears and misshapen teeth.

There is a 20% chance that when goblins are en-

king has a bodyguard of 2d6 goblins who fight as

A golem is a "construct," a powerful, en·
chanted m onster created and animated by a high
level magic-user or cleric. Golems can be made
of almost any material. The DM should feel free
to create new types as desired.
Golems can only be damaged by magic or
magical weapons. They are also immune to
sleep, charm, and hold spells, as well as all gases
```
(since they do not breathe). The creation of a go-
```
tern is discussed in Chapter 16.

immune to aJl cold-based attacks and all missile
fire, including magic missile spe lls.

Mud Go1em: A mud golem Stands about 6'
tall and is shaped much like a muscular human
fighter. It can swim or walk on the surface of
mud and quicksand without sinking. It can re·
main submerged in the subStances indefinitely
without sinking, rising to the surface when it
wishes. Mud golems hug their victims with both
arms, trying to smother the victim in its body. Lf
a mud golem hits, it will automatically cause 2d6
points of smothering damage each round there·
after.
Amber Gol em : These resemble giant cats,
usually lions or tigers. They are faultless trackers
and can detect invisible creatures within 60'.
Bronze Golem : These creations look somewhat
like fue giants and stand 16' tall. Their skin is
bronze and their blood is liquid fire . Any creature
hit by a bronze golem takes !diO extra points of

Gremlins a.re 3'-tall humanoids with pasty
gray-green skin, large saucer-shaped eyes and
pointed ears. They arc whimsi ca l and have an
evil sense of humor. Grem lins can radiate a cha -
otic aura with a 20' radius. Inside the area of ef-
fect, "anything that can go wrong will go
wrong" ar the OM's discretion. Characters mu st
successfully save vs. spells each round to avoid
the effect of the gremlins.
Gremli ns have no arrack other than their cha-
otic aura. However, any creature that attacks a
gremlin an d misses must roll a second attack
against him- or herself. Any cha.racter casting a
spell within the chaotic aura must roll a save vs .
spells. If successful, the spell affectS the grem-
```
lins; if un successful , the spell affectS the caster.
```
Gremlin magic usually affects mechanical de-
vices before nonmechanical devices. A crossbow
might break in half, axeheads might fall off their
shaft, etc. The exact effectS of gremlin magic de-
pends on the OM 's imagination. In general, the
magic is not deadly but is playfully malignant.
Gremlins live in deep, hidden caves.

A harpy bas the lower body of a giant eagle
and the upper body and head of a hideous-
looking woman. Harpies can sing with enchant-
ing, mesmerizing voices. By singing, harpies
lure creatures to them, to be killed and de-
voured. Any creature hearing the harpies' songs
must malce a saving throw vs . spe Us or be
charmed. lf a victim malces a saving throw
against the songs of a group of harpies, the vic-
tim will not be affected by any of their songs
during the encounter.
Harpies typically malce their nests in out-of-
the-way places where there is a certain amount of
human uaffic: beside mountain passes along
caravan routes, on small hills along uade routes,
etc . The harpies try to lure all travelers to their
death. Should they succeed to the point that no
new travelers ever come by, they will simply
move co a new site and start all over again.

Headsmen (also called "executioners") are
```
NPC humans co mmonl y employed by dominion
rulers. Th ey are trainc:tl in the business of killing
criminals wb o have received the death penalty.
Most headsmen are skilled in the proper use of
bladed weapons, ropes, and poisons and are able
to execute criminals quickly and neatly.
All professional headsmen belong to their
own guild, which is associated with the Thieves'
Guild. Headsmen keep their uue identities
completely secret, wearing hoods or disguises
when engaged in professional activities. Man y
own ordinary shops, and can seem to be perfectly
ordinary townsfolk. Headsmen of 6 HD or more
are 90% undetectable in their disguises, and
study Languag es of all sons to improve their mas-
querades. Headsmen of 10 HD or more can even
use the secret languages of other alignments.
```
Thugs: A secret organization exists within the
```
Guild of H ea dsmen. These evil headsmen enjoy
their work too much, and offer their services for
```
open hire. Others call them Assassins or Thugs;
```
```
they ca ll themselves Pragmati (" the practical
```
```
people").
```
Unlike the Thieves' Guild, the Pragmati are
not supported by adventurers or rulers. They are
sometimes hired by other NPCs, especially evil
ones. However, PCs do not no rmally contact these
```
headsmen for any reason ; their organization is
```
dangerous as either an enemy or an ally. Thugs are
treacherous and self-serving, known to exrort
mo ney from their previ ous "clients" with threats
of exposure, kidnapping, or even murder.
ambush a pany if the chan ce for success is good,
es pecially if the pany has recently been wound-
ed. Sometimes thugs may be hired as guards, if
assu red of h.igb level clerical assistance when in-
jured or slain. They may rarely be found working
with bandits or other renegade groups, often un-
beknownst to the bandits themselves.
Thug Special Abilities: Thu gs know methods
to kill quicldy, neatly, and silentl y. A thug also
has the same special abilities as a thief of the
```
same level; for example, a 6 Hit Di e thug can
```
cl imb walls with a 92% chance of success. Thugs
use standard monster attack ro ll tables, not those
for characrers.
A thug may make preparations to surprise a vic·
```
tim; if so, a roU of 1·3 (instead of 1-2 ) indi cates su r·
```
prise . These preparations often include disguise ,
```
success at moving silently (as the thief ability), and
```
a strong cord or edged weapon held ready, possibly
while successfully hiding in shadows .
If a prepared thug gains surprise, the victim
may be slain with a sing le blow, regardless of hit
```
points. No attack roll is made; instead, the base
```
chance of success is 50%, modi.fied by the differ·
ence in Hit Di ce, as follows : if the victim's level
is greater than the Thug's, subtraet 5% per Hit
```
Die; if the virum 's level is less than the Thug 's,
```
add 5% per Hit Die. If the thug does not gain
surprise, a ooanal attack roiJ is made, and nor-
mal damage is ioflicted if the attempt succeeds.
A successful hit may also require the victim to
make a saving throw vs. poison if the thug is us-
ing a poisoned blade.
```
Example: A 7 HD thug attempting to kill a 3
```
```
HD fighter has a chance of 50% plus 20% (for 4
```
```
HD difference in the thug's favor), or 70%. If
```
the same thug tried to kill a 25 th level fighter
```
lord, the chance is 50% minus 10 % (2 HD dif-
```
```
ference in the victim's favor), or 40%. Rem em·
```
```
ber that the fighter has o nly 9 HD (despite h is or

"The hordes" arc life forms native to the ele-

hundreds of separate inscctlike bodies. The size

length corresponds to the H it Dice (i.e., a 3-HD

```
bodies are given above.
One horde life force can control up to 10.000
Hit Dice of bodies. Replacement bodies can be
created at the rate of I Hit Die per turn. Unlike
insects, there is no "queen" body : the life force
is widely spread, occupying all the bodies evenly.
The life force can only control bodies within a
volume 100 miJes across : if taken outside that
range, a body becomes a mindless thing, dying

feed on. MOSt wild horses on the plains fall into
the "riding horse" category once tamed.
War H orse: This type of horse is bred for its
warlike temperament and suength. Unlike other
horses, it is trained to charge. When charging,
its rider can do double damage when using a
lance . The horse cannot fight while charging,
in 1-10 days. Each planet in the realm of the
hordes is occupied by 1d100 life forces .
Each individual life force has its own name.
All the bodies of a single life force will respond
to the same name, and this can cause confusion
in dealing with a horde creature. The creature it·
self can only die if all of its bodies arc desuoyed.
The horde crearures do not consider any other
life forms to be imdligem. When a horde needs
more room , it will simply try to take it, without
regard for other creatures: thus, they arc consid-
ered evil. The horde creatures often grapple with
each other in this war for living space.
A horde creature can usc ESP and telekinesis
```
(up to 2,000 en) as often as desired, up to once
```
per round. It communicates by rclepachy, speak-
ing directly to the minds of others. It is incredi-
bly intelligent, and can easily handle dozens of
conversations at once.
Each horde is very Lawful and always danger-
ous. A horde creature sacrifices as many bodies as
needed to reach a goal, and thus the morale of a
body is 12. The creature is immune to all mental
```
effects (charm, bold, sleep, etc.), but the bodies
```
are susceptible to blows and damage-cawing at·
tacks of most rypes. Because of its disregard for
individual bodies, a horde normalJy docs not
```
bother to attempt to save them; in play, it simply
```
fails all saving throws voluntarily. However, if
10% or more of a horde's bodies arc lost in a sin-
```
gle acciviry (an encounter with enemies. for ex-
```
```
ample), the creature will either resolve the
```
```
problem peacefully (negotiating, avoiding, etc.)
```
or calJ other ho rdes for assistance .
Each horde can have a different species of in-
sect as its bodies. One horde might consist of
bodies which look l.ikc huge gold praying man-
rises with wings, whiJc another might consist of
smallish black beetles with glowing red tips on
their antennae.
The hordes' enemies arc the kryst and the un-
dines. They fear fife-type creatures and attacks.

The hydra will anack with all of its heads every
round. For every 8 points of damage a hydra
takes, one head is desuoycd. For example, if a 7·
headed hydra took 18 points of damage. it would
only anack with 5 heads in the next round.

An in visible stalker is a magical humanlike
m onster from another plane of existence, sum -
moned b y the magic-user spell invisible st:A!kcr.
If the summoned stalker is given a simple task
that is dear and can be swiftly completed , it will
obey promptly. If the task is com plex or lengthy,
the creature will try to diston the intent while
obeying the literal command . For examp le , if or-
```
derc:d to guard a treasure longer than a week, the
```
stalker may take it away to its own plane of exist-
```
ence: and guard it there forever.
```
An invisible stalke r is most often used to track
and slay enemies. It is highly int ell igent , and a
fau ltless tracker. If a vic tim cannot detect invisi-
ble things, the stalker will surprise on a r oU of 1-

This shapeless monster appears as a puddle or
stream of hot molten rock, about 10' x 10'. It
l ives in or near a volcano or other place of great
heat. Although the ooze is native to the Prime
Plane. it can freely exist on the elemental plane
of Fire.
Lava ooze is fluid. able to pass through small
holes or cracks. It can sense vibrations within 60'.
The monster att.acks by extending pseudopods
```
(up to three per roun d) from its fl uid body to
```
strike at its opponents up to 1~' away. Each hit
inflicts 4d6 points of dam age, and leaves a coat·
ing of lava that inflicts 3d6 points of automatic
heat damage per round for ld4 rounds there-
after. Multiple hits on a single opponent do not
increase this heat damage. but the durations are
cumu lative.
The lava ooze is mindless and attacks until de-
```
stroyed. It is immune to fire (both normal and
```
```
magical) and to aiJ mind attacks (including
```
```
charm, ESP. etc.). but takes double damage

A lich is a powerful undead monster of magi-
cal origin. It looks like a skeleton wearing fine
garments, and was once an evil and chaotic
```
magic-user or cleric of level 21 or greater (often
```
```
27-36). A lich is sciJJ able to use spciJs as it did
```
while alive, so it is exuemely dangerous. A lich is
not normally found wandering, but instead re-
mains in or very near a well-defended lair. Such a
lair might be a dungeon, catacomb, tom b, or
```
necropolis ("city of the dead") .
```
The very sight of a lich causes fear in all char·
```
acters below ~th level (no saving throw). I ts
```
merest touch causes 1d 10 points of damage, and
```
can paralyze any creature for 1d100 days (though
```
a saving throw a pp lies. and the paralysis is magi-
```
cally dispe ll able).
```
Before any encounter with a lich, the OM
should select spells for the creature. This should
be done with care, as a lich is extremely intelli-
gent and uses them to its best advantage. Note
that the lich's morale is given as 10, but a lich
flees if in actual danger.
```
Liches are undead, and can be turned (but not
```
```
desuoyed) by clerics. They are immune to
```
charm , sleep, fecblemind, polymorph, cold,
lighrning, and death spells, and can be harmed
only by magical weapons. They are also immune
to the effects of all spells of less than 4th level.
Outside of its lair, a lich always carries ld4 + 1
powerful magica.l items to be used in case of
trouble. You should choose these, not randomly
determine them. Within its lair, a lich has 4d8
```
additional temporary magical items (or more),

which looks like a cross between an iguana and a
toad. It has pebble-colored olive skin with white
spikes along its back. A tuatara has a membrane
over itS eyes which, when lowered, is sensitive to
changes in temperature, allowing it to "see" in
```
darkness (90' infravision).

uzard men arc semi-intelligent and use spears

and large clubs (treat the clubs as maces). gain-

ing a bonus of + I on damage ro lls due to their
great strength.
One in ten will speak a little Common. PCs
can negotiate with lizard men that can talk. If
they are hungry enough. though. and the PCs
can't deliver them a lot of food, the: lizard mc:n
will still prefer to eat the characters. uzard men
live hard lives, hunting most of their waking
hours. Sometimes they hire themselves out to
other races as warri ors or scoutS . They have no
interest in other races other than what those races
```
can do fo r them (i .e .• provide food in one way or
```
```
another).
```
Some varieties of lizard men arc just drab
green or brown in color, while others may be dra·
matically colorful: Bright reds, blues, ye llows, or
greens, like some other reptiles .

Giant locusts arc 2'·3' long and live under·

ground. They m ay be mistllkcn for statues (or

```
might not be noticed at all) until approached,
```
because of their Stone -gray color. They are her·
bivores, and also eat fungus such as yellow mold
110d shriekcrs. They cannot be harmed by yellow
mold or most poisons.
Instead of fighting, they usually flee by jump-
```
ing away (up to 60'). UnfortUnately they often
```
become confused, 110d may accidentally jump
```
into a party (50% chance per jump). If so, a vic·
```
tim is determined randomly and an anack roll is
made. If the giant locust hits a character, the vic·
tim is battered for ld4 points of damage. The
locust then flies away.
When frightened or attacked, giant locusts
mllke a loud shrieking noise to warn their fel-
lows . In dungeons, this shriek has a 20% ch110ce
per round of attracting wandering monsters.
If cornered, a giant locust will spit a brown
gooey substance up to 10' . The target is treated
as AC 9 regardless of his true: armor cl:ass. A vic·
tim hit by giant locust spinlc must make: a saving
throw vs . poison or be unable to do anything for
I tum, due to the awful smell. After this time
the victim will be used to the smell, but any
character approaching within 5' must also mllkc:
a saving th row or suffer the same effectS. This
aroma will last until the spittle is washed off.

rats arc sneaky and often set ambushes, surpris-
```
ing on a roll of 1-4 (on ld 6). They summon giant
```
rats to help them in battle . Only a wererar 's bite
causes lycanthropy.

A malfe ra is a creatu re fro m the Dimension of
Nig htmares, where many evil dreams arc bred
and released imo the minds of sleeping people.
A maJfera appears only through the acts of a
```
powe rful magi c- use r or an Immortal ; its dimen-
```
sion is believed poisonous and deadly to hu-
man s.
```
The: malfera has a large, elcphantlikc face and
```
a s hon trunk . The head is topped by large horns.
Large fangs protrude from eithe r side of the
trunk. The chest is a mass of slimy. sh ort tenta-
cles. Long. mu scular arms end in large , jagged
pin cers. Its feet arc web bed and clawed. It is co l-
ored night -black but has red veins and eyes.
In combat, a malfera attacks with pin cers and
bites. If both pincers hit the same target, the vic-
tim is dragged to the chest of the malfera on the
next ro und . The tentacles then automatically
uap the victim . These tentacles arc coated with
an acid slime and do 2d6 points of damage each
round . The victim can be freed on ly when the
malfera is killed.
In addition, the breath of a malfcra is poison-
o us. Each time it hits with a bite, its victim mu st
```
save vs. poison (at a + 3 bonus) or die . A malfcra
```
is immune to acid and can be struck onl y by
m agical weapon s.
Aside fro m its combat abilities, a malfcra can
derecc invisible and ope n a ll doots as if it had a
kn ock spell. Because of its 10ugh con stitution
and highly magical nature, it saves as a 13th level

Manta rays are aquatic crea tures. flat fiSh

sails . They flap their "wings" to propel them
through the water. When a manta ray lies in the
sand on the ocean floor it is completely invisible. ·
Normal Manta Ray: Normal manta rays can
grow to be 7' in width and 12' in length. The ta.il
on the mama ray has many sharp poisonous
spines that can paralyze its victim. They attack
with this ta.il. A saving throw vs . poison will pre-
vent paralysis.
Giant Manta Ray: Giant manta rays can be up
to about 40' in width and 75' in length. Beside
```
the poisonous tail. they can also buffet (ram) a

creature for 3d4 points of damage. They feed
from the ocean floor and sometimes swallow

A manticore is a horrid monster with the body
of a lion, leathery bat wings, a ta.il ridged with
spi kes, and the face of a mao with large. sharp
fangs . It usually lives in wild mouma.in ranges.
The manticore has 24 ta.il spikes, and can
```
shoot six each round even when flying (ranges
```
```
50/100/180). The creature regrows rwo spi kes
```
per day. Its favorite food is man.
Mamicores frequently track humans, ambush-
ing them with spike attacks when the human
group stops to rest. Another tactic is to stalk its
prey like a great cat, creeping up close on an un-
suspecring vicrim. When that victim is alone.
the manticore fires off a barrage of tail-spikes to
bring the victim down. The manticore then cats
the victim. Less frequently, a pack of manti cores
will stalk and attack a group of vicrims.

A medusa looks like a human female with live
snakes growing from her head instead of hair. Me-
dusae ue very magical , and the mere sight of a
medusa will rurn a creature to stone unless the vic-
tim makes 2 s:~ving throw vs . rurn to Stone. How-
ever, this will affect on ly one characrcr per round.
and c hara.cters may watch the reflection of a me-
dusa in a mirror without danger. If a medusa sees
her own refl ection, she must make a saving throw
vs. rurn to Slone or she will petrify herself!
ln combat, the medusa makes one attack roll
for the bites of the snakes, and if they hit, the
```
victim must make a saving throw vs . poison (in
```
```
addition to taking ld6 points of damage) or die
```
in one rurn. A medusa will often wear a robe
with a hood for disguise so she can trick her vic-
tims into looking at her. Medusae occasionally
use weapons.
Anyone who tries to attack a medusa without
looking at her must subuact 4 from the attack
roll. and the snakes may attack with a +2 bonus
to the arrack roll . A medusa also gains + 2 on all
saving throws vs . spells due to her magical narurc.
Many medusae uc evil. Others arc reclusive
scholars, ancient sages who can guide heroes on
their quests and who conceal their deadly visages

additional 4th level fighter acting as commander
of the entire group.
Half of the brigands have leather armor,
shield, short bow, and sword. The rest are
mounted on riding horses. wear chain mail, and
carry shields and swords. The leaders wear plate
mail. carry swords and lances. and ride war
horses with ba.rding.
Brigands often band together in fortified
camps of 50· 300 men. A camp is always led by a
9th level fighter, with an additional 5th level
fighter for every 50 brigands. There is also a 50%
chance that a magic-user of level 9-11 is in the

Mermen are water-breathing humanoids. A
merman has the upper body of a man and the
lower body of a large ftSh . Mermen are armed
with spears, tridents, or daggers. They live in
coastal waters and hunt fish and harvest kelp.
Except for leaders, all mermen have I Hit Die
and save as 1st level fighters .
The number appearing represents a small
hunting party, although mermen often form
underwater villages of id3 x 100 members. For
every ten mermen encountered, there is an addi-
tional leader with 2 Hit Dice. For every 50 there
is one leader with 4 H it Dice. Mermen leaders
save as fighters of a level equal to their Hit Dice.
Mermen often keep trained marine monsters
and animals to help guard their homes.
Mermen are the people of the sea, and a OM
can use them the same way as NPC humans .

Metamorphs look very simil:u to humans, but
have pointed ears and pure white eyes. They are
closely related to humans but , as a species, are
masters of the ancaent an of shapesh.ifting. They
are not lycamhropes . though the y are sometimes
mistaken for them
A metamorph can shapeshift up to II times
each day. but only into certain forms. Unlike the
polymorph sdfspell effect, this non magical sha-
peshift gives the metamorph all the abilities of
```
the new form ; even special attacks (such as a
```
```
skunk's spray) are gained. Metamorphs cannot
```
take giant-sized or fantastic forms, but can take
any normal nonmagical form .
The forms a metamorph can use each day are:
Worm Insect Reptile
Leech Crustacean Amphibian
Spider Mammal Fish
Centipede Bird
```
Peter Munkholm (Order #50026923)
```
For example. a mc:tamorph can rurn into a
mammal once per day. One day he may choose: to
become a monkey. and the next day a wolf. Once
a choice has been used . the mc:tamorph cannot
change into that choice any more that day. E2ch
shapcshift lasu up to I hour. and the mc:tamorph
can assume normal form at any time.

If 7 or 8 mystics arc encountered, one will be a
leader with 7 Hit Dice . The leader raises the mo-
rale of the mystics to 10. The leader can strike
creatures vulnerable to +I magical weapons with
his hand attacks. Although one or more mystics
might join a group if it is in the interest of their
order. mystics can also be hired at a standard rate
of ~0 gp per day per Hit Die of the mystic.
Mystics can often be recognized by their robes
or other unusual garb. but another distinctive
feature is their salute. Upon mcccing another
creatu re presumed to be peaceful, the mystic
ra.ises a fiSt, covers it with the other hand, and
```
bows slightl y. This symbolizes greetings (the
```
```
bow), readiness to fight if necessary (the fiSt),
```
```
but peaceful intentions (the covered fiSt).
```
Further details on mystic cloisters can be
found on pages 134 and 138.

not affected unless the monster actually picks
them up. The creature may. however, automati-

```
tures (from a fallen opponent, for example), by
```
crushing it.
A nighrwalker has the ability to gaze at one
opponent per round. to a 60' range. The victim
may make a saving throw vs . spells to avoid the
```
gaze; if it is failed , the victim is cursed. suffering

Nightwing: This appears similar to a gigantic

bat, solid blade in color, with a ~o · wingspre2d.
Its lim :art:ack is normally a swoop downward,
and its high speed gives it a 90% chance of sur-
```
prising opponents (unless they have experience

with nightshades. which negates surprise as ex-

plai ned above).
```
Any victim hit by a nig htwing must make a
saving throw vs . spells. If he fails th is saving

```
turned into a bat is a servant of the nighrwing

For example, a blacksmith could have 7 hit

An NPC party is any group of nonplayer char-
acters. Each NPC may be of any class. level, and
alignment. All rules for player characters apply
to NPCs. An NPC pany may be created in great
detail before a game or created on the spot.
```
Most parties (whether NPCs or PCs) will nor
```
want to fight other parries, preferring monsters
to challenge. The DM may wish to avoid the
large, complicated banlc: that could occur be-
tween two parties. When PCs meet an NPC par-
ty, decide how the: NPCs will react, or roll a
```
reaction. Modify the roll if you choose (perhaps
```
the NPCs have heard of the PC party, or are even
```
familiar with them as allies, rivals, or enemies).

seen, naps found, stairs up or down, or other
features. The DM should de cide on the price of-

A plasm looks like a human- or giant-sited

cmcnt . A plasm is made of a combination of clc-
```
memal material and ectoplasm (solid ether). It
```
cannot safely exist on any plane except the Ethe-
real, and is sometimes encountered within a
wormhole. On any plane except the Ethereal, a
plasm automatically loses I Hit Die per round
from energy drain, vanishing when dead.
A plasm feeds on its clement, and regenerates
damage when feeding at the: rate: of I point per

will callS(: a plasm to gain Hit Dice and hit points.
```
For example, a fireball cast at a fire plasm by a 9th
level magic-user would cause it to immediately
```
ga.in 9 additional Hit Dice (9d8 hit points).
```
Plasms arc immune to poison and normal
weapons, and arc only slightly damaged by mag-
ical weapons. Each blow from a magical weapon
```
inflins only its magic damage ("p lusscs"), ig-
```
noring norma l weapon damage and strength bo-
nuses. For example, a sword +4 would inflict 4
points of damage: on a plasm.
A plasm can only be damaged by magical
```
weapons (as given above) and by anack forms
```
based on elemental dominance.
Once per turn. a plasm can "spend" 10 of its
hit points to create an acid cloud based on its cle-
ment. This cloud is a 30' diameter sphere, which
```
inflicts 20 points of damage to all within it (ex-
```
```
cept the plasm); each victim may make a saving
```
throw vs. dragon breath to take half damage.
The cloud lasts for ld6 rounds. A plasm normal-
ly saves this attack form to use when fleeing.

Most snakes are carnivores but prefer prey small

Spitting Cobra: A spirting cobra is a 3' long

Spectral hounds are creatures from the Di-
mensional Vorrex - rhe void between a ll dimen-
sions. In this world they appear as ghostly
dogs-pale in color and translucent. Their eyes
are formless pools of utter blackness. They arc
excellent trackers and once on the trail of a crea-
ture, they follow it for days. They arc bred and
```
trained by interplanar beings (such as elemental
```
```
rulers, amirs, pashas, etc.) as hunting animals,
```
and are sometimes used to track intrusive adven-
turers back to their home planes. Likewise , ad-
venturers mighr be able to charm spectral
hounds and train them to track villains through
the planes. Spectral hounds never come to the
Prime Plane except when being used in this
manner by greater powers.
In combat, a spectral hound anacks by biting.
Any character binen by a spectral hound must
save vs. spells. If he saves, the character suffers
only the 2d6 points of damage from the bite. if
he fails to save, he begins to fade. This fading is
very gradual: In 24 hours the charaner has faded
to the same translucent appearance as a spectral
hound . The character's equipment is not affect-
ed. When rhe charaner finishes fading co m-
pletel y, he is unable ro hold any normal items.
He is unable to hear or talk 10 unfaded charac-
ters. From the faded character 's point of view. all
normal things appear translucent, whi le faded
```
things (i .e. the spectral hounds and other affect-
```
```
ed characters) seem solid and normal.
```
Chapter 14: Monsters ·
At any time after a characrer has been affect-
ed, he may be restored to the normal world by a
dimension door spe ll . When the spell is cas t , the
affected character or characters can step through
the dimension door and rerurn to the normal
world.
Spectral hounds may be struck by silver or
m agica l weapons, but not by normal weapons.
They are immune tO fire- and co ld-based spells.

A sphinx is a large. winged creature with ali-
on's body and a human's face . It is fond of dry
climates, bur may be encountered anywhere,
most often as a guard. Some Chaotic sphinxes
are very territorial, settling on a hilltop near a
road and preventing all travelers from passing
along that road .
Both male and female sphinxes arc very imel-
ligcm spellcasters, the female a 12th level cleric
and the male a 12 level magic-user. Their magic
is so powerful that all saving throws against their
spe lls arc made with a -4 penalty.
In combat, a sphinx can attack with claws and
```
bite (or spells), but its most feared attack is its
```
roar. The roar is usable only twice per day, but is
quite powerful. Each victim within 120' must
make a saving throw vs. spells at a -4 penalty or
flee in fear for ld6 turns. Each victim within 60'
```
must check for fear (as above) and must also
```
make a saving throw vs. paralysis or be stunned
```
for 1-6 rounds. (Sec the "Special Character Con-
```
ditions" section of Chapter 13 for more on the
```
effects of srunning.) Each victim within 10' must
```
```
check for fear and srun (as above), but also takes
```
6d6 points of damage, and is deafened for ldlO
```
turns (no saving throw).
```
The sphinx is immune to all 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
level spells and to nonmagical weapons. It loves
puzzles, riddles, and trivia. Characters may
avoid combat or gain the sphinx's friendship by
solving the sphinx's riddles.
If two sphinxes arc encountered together. they
```
arc a mated pair; if more than two arc encoun-
```
tered, they are a mated pair with cubs.

Giant spiders are simply huge versions of nor-
mal spider species. All giant spiders can be dan-
gerous, and many are poisonous. All arc
carnivores, either trapping their prey in webs or
jumping at victims by surprise. However, they are
rarely intelligent, and will often flee from fire.
Three examples of giant spiders are given here.
Crab Spider: This is a 5' long spider with a
chameleon like ability to blend into its surround-
```
ings, surprising on a roll of 1-4 (on ld6). It clings
```
to walls or ceilings and drops onto its prey. After
the first anack, it can be seen and anacked nor-
mally. Any victim of its bite must make a saving
throw vs. poison or die in ld4 turns. However,
the poison is weak, and the victim gains a + 2
bonus to the saving throw roll.
Black Widow Spider: This vicious arachnid is
6' long, and has a red "hourglass" mark on its
belly. It usually stays close to its webbed lair. The
webs should be ueated as the magic-u.ser's web
spell for the of breaking free, once en-
125
trapped. The webs may also be burned away.
Any victim of the bite of a black widow spider
must make a saving throw vs. poison or die in I
turn.
```
Tarantella: A tarantella is a huge hairy magical
```
spider that looks like a 7' long tarantula. Its bite
```
does nor kill; instead, it causes the victim (if a
```
```
saving throw vs. poison is failed) to have painful
```
spasms that resemble a frantic dance. This dance
has a magical effect on onlookers. Anyone
watching the dance muse make a saving throw
vs. spells or stan to dance in the same way. Danc-
ing victims have a penalty of -4 on their attack
rolls, and attackers gain + 4 on their attack rolls.
The effects of the bite last for 2d6 turns. How-
ever, dancers will drop from exhaustion in 5
turns, and they will then be helpless against at-
tacks. Those caught while watching will dance as
```
long as the original victim. (A dispel magic spell
```
```
will stop the dance.)

Monster Type: Planar Monster (Vcty Rare).
```
The "planar spiders" are intelligent plane-
traveling arachnids with a vast, but odd, civiliza-
tion. They can travel through planes and
dimensions at will. Those most commonly en-
countered have 5 Hit Dice, but leaders of up to
12 Hit Dice have been found . Their home plane
is not known, and no traces of cities have ever
```
been discovered; planar spiders describe it as a
```
world covered with cities made up of buildings
lovingly crafted from imperishable white webs.
Planar spiders are widely-enough traveled that
most speak Common.
In combat, a planar spider arrives from an-
```
other plane (usually the Ethereal), attacks, and
```
then "shifts" back to the other plane. It auto-
matically gains initiative when "shifting," and
```
usually (75%) cannot be attacked before it
```
leaves! However, hasted opponents may attack
normally before the creature "shifts."
Normally, any victim bitten must make a sav-
ing throw vs. poison with a -4 penalty to the
roll, or die. However, the creature can choose to
bite without using the poison, if desired.
Any spi der encountered may have ld3 miscel-
laneous magical items that it can use. or it may
have ld4 odd but nonmagical items with which
it- but not humans-is fam iliar.
Occasional rare encounters may be with
spellcasting planar spider clerics or magic-users
```
(maximum 9th level in either). For XP calcula-
```
tions, one asterisk is added for each rwo levels of
spell use. Plana.r spiders that cast spells cannot
cast spells and then phase out in the same round.
Planar spiders will not autOmatically anack
PCs. In fact , since they ' re the primary intelli-
gence of their own planes, they should be played
much like humans. There could be planar-spider
bandits, NPC adventuring parties, etc. Most,
when encountered, will speak to PCs and find
out their intentions toward him: This could be a
real surprise to charancrs who have only encoun-
tered "normal" giant spiders!

```
plant reaclhes out ( 10-30' range), attacking as a

```
damage per hit (in addition to poison).
```
The plant is immediately killed when the odic
possesses it. The crt-ature uses the plant's parts to
seek out other life to feed on. Most commonly, it
animates individual leaves, which float away
```
(move ment rate 30' per round) in search of victims;
```
it can animate up to 6 such leaves at one lime. The
leaves may be scm up to I mile &om the odic. Ani·

Each leaf attacks as if a 4 Hit Dice monster; no

The sporaclc appears identical to a beholder at
first glance: a floating ball-like creature.~· in di-
ameter, with a huge gaping mouth :tnd a large
central eye above it. Tentacles sprout from itS en-
tire body. It has six eyes. positioned evenly about
```
the surface of the body (top, bottom. front;
```
```
back, sides). It normally keeps all but a few up-
```
per tcnracles retracted .
A sporaclc regenerates by submersing itSelf in
```
fresh water (but not in brine) at the rate of 3 hit
```
points per round so lost body pans may be rap-
idly regrown. If a loose tentacle falls or is placed
in water, it will grow into a whole creature in I
hou r. This is their only method of reproduction ,
so they are often found ncar a water source.
A sporacle may attack anything. but prefers
humanoids as food . As it moves int o combat, it
extends all itS tentacles, appearing to s prou t
them as it attacks. It moves throug h air or water
by magical flight , but is very quick. It s pins rap-
idly in all directions when 10 combat , wing all of

The sporacle prefers not 10 bite victims that
are still movi ng. It uses itS tentacle attacks only.
```
until all have been destroyed ; only then will it
```
resort to its ferocious bite . Each tentacle hit in-
flicts I point of damage . and each requires a sav-
ing throw vs . paralysis. Failure indicates that the
venomous tentacle has struck skin, and takes ef-
fect. This paralysis is a delayed sort, however.

The sporacle may be damaged by any sort of

· Chapter 14: Monsters
Changing Monsters
. The given monster descriptions are guide-
hoes. The OM can change dcuils of any individ-
ual monster to suit the needs of the campaign or
of a specific adventure. Unexpected changes add
new levels of excitement and mystery.
Basic Ways to Vary
Monsters
1. Change the Phys ical Descrip ti on.
• Arctic snakes that have white fur but are
otherwise identical to rock pythons.
• Oxen cross-bred with gorgons. resem-
bling the former, but with the statistics
and breath weapon of the Iau er.
• A tribe of sma ll cannibal s: short and
wizened bald men with bushy eyebrows,
red tattoos of serpents on their arms, and
```
filed teeth (kobo ld statistics).
```
2. Add Special Abilities.
• Skeletons that hurl their finger joints as
magic missiles
• A larger than average basilisk. such that
saves versus its pe~rification are at -2.
• A halfling village whose militia is + 2
with slings instead of + I .
• Winged elves with a flying move of 150 '
```
(50').
```
3. Take Details From Nature.
```
• Spiders that throw nets of web (up to
```
```
120') to snare their prey.
```
• Snakes, such as the poisonous coral
snake and the harmless king snake, told
apart by the order of their colored band-
ing.
```
• Flying squirrels (possibly carnivorous or
```
```
rabid ) that glide to attack intruders.
```
• Creatures using natural behavioral pat·
```
terns: such as hunting packs that drive
```
the prey into ambush set by other pack
```
members; or animals that threaten and
```
retreat instead of mindlessly attacking.
4. Usc Unusual Thctics or Weapons.
• A giant "bags" characters with a giant
sack instead of using a weapon.
```
• An ogre uses an unusual club (the only
```
```
oar of a boat the party finds later).
```
• Kobolds usc flasks of flaming oil and pit
traps that open when someone heavier
than 50 pounds steps on them.
• Arctic cavemen peh the party with blad-
ders of seal blood, which attracts raven-
ous polar bears.
• Hobgoblins se t spears against party
charges. while their archers fire over-
head.
• A wizard owns a pair of charmed and
hasted hydras.
5. Create NPCs Wi th Special Att ack forms.
• The King's Executioner, who has a + 2
attack bonus with his axe, and chops off
a man-sized opponent's head on a natu·
cal ro ll of 20.
• An ore cook carrying a pan of grease,
who wi ll throw it in front of the party be-
```
fore he runs away (PCs slip. slide. aod
```
```
possibly fall if they pursue).
```
• A Lawful archer, who ca n shoot a weap-
on out of someone's hand. sever a rope,
or make any other type of nondamaging
shot with his nonnal attack roll.
6. Reverse Party Expectations.
```
• An ochre jelly hiding up a chimney; soot
```
covered, it looks like a black pudding.
• A goollleadcr that , when it sees the par-
ry, snarls: " It 's about time you got here.
Fall in and follow me ..."
• A room with giant spiders that has re-
```
versed graviry (the spiders look right·
```
side up, but arc actually on the room 's
```
ceiling) .
```
7. Create Campaign-Based Cultu ra l Details.
• A local encounter table that changes the
```
frequency of monsters, including (or ex-
```
```
cluding) certain creatures. Special NPCs
```
can be added to :Suc h tables.
• A hidden sect of druids who are Chaotic
and evil due to an ancient curse.
• Orcs with different tribal Hairs :
I. Orcs of the Red Hand seldom run in
```
combat ( + 2 morale bonus).
```
2. Orcs of the Crooked Tooth are cow-
ardly and won' t attack unless they
have at least 2-to-1 odds. They arc es-
pecially treacherous and unuu st·
worthy, even for orcs .
3. Orcs of the Yellow Eye arc assassins
who prefer garrotes and blowguns.
```
They a.re seldom see n; m:any have
```
clerical spells. Each has a small dagger
tattooed somewhere on its body.
4. Orcs of the White Mountain usc
black-flctched arrows. They always
keep their word once they give it, and
suffer no penalty in bright light.
8. Make Special Combination Monsters.
• Pixie a.rchcrs riding giant bees.
• A troll lord with a ring of acid resistance,
and horn ofblasring, riding a giant slu g.
• A medusa with rwice normal hit dice.
armed with a magic bow and poisoned
arrows + 2, and immune to the effects of
her reflected gaze.
• A symbiotic black pudding shaped like a
black dragon , that spits green slime.
• An obsidian golcm that shatters when
slain, revealing a bronze golcm inside.
```
This belches out small (2·3 Hit Die) fire
```
```
clcmc:mals each round until slain.
```
The most important thing to remember :about
changing monsters is that the parry will be set up
by their familiarity with the existing monsters.
Have fun!
Sometimes a more detailed approach to
0anging monsters in useful. The following op-
uonal rules can be used if desired .
Monster Intelligence
The Intelligence of a creature is a valu:able
guide to role-playing an encounter. Stupid crea-
```
tures may make tactical er rors in combat; smart
```
ones may surprise characters with brilliant traps.
verbal assaultS. and fast reactions to unexpected
situations. Intelligence is also needed to find the
results of a ch:um or maze spell.
In the Monster List , average Intelligence scores
are given for each monster race. But individuals
may have higher or lower Intelligences. Spell-
casters always have higher-than-average Intelli-
```
gence, for instance; leaders often do .
```
To determine the Intelligence of an individual,
find the average Intelligence of its race from the
monster description. Go to the line corresponding
to that score on the Monster Intelligence table.
```
Roll rwo six-sided dice (2d6). The first die is used
```
to determine how much this individual's Intelli-
```
gence va.ries from the race's average; move across
```
10 the co lumn corresponding to the number you
rolled. The second die is used to determine
```
whether to subtract (H) or add (4-6) this amount
```
from the race's average. 1Ieat resu lts of less than 0
as 0 and results of greater than 18 as 18 . Vampires
and lowlifes ignore subtractions.

Ex:~mple: The merman has a listed Intelli-

gence of 12. To determine the score of an indi-
vidual merman , a OM goes to the "9· 12 "1incon
the t:able :above. He rolls ld6 and the result is a
```
4; therefore, the va.riation will be a 2. He rolls
```
```
another ld6 and the result is a 6; therefore, the
```
var!ation will be added to the Intelligence score.
Thts merman's actual Intelligen ce is 14.
Size
The Hit Dice given for a type of creature
shou ld be taken as the average for the species.
Both smaller and larger versions often exist. To
change the size of a monster, decide whether you
want this specific monster to be smaller or la.rgcr
```
than :average. Then, usc the following modifiers:
```
If smaller:
-3 Much smaller than normal
- 2 Smaller than normal
- I Slightly smaller than normal
If larger:
+I
+2
+3
Slightly larger than normal
```
La.rgcr than normal (2- 3 X size)
```
Much larger than normal
```
(4 + x size)
```
Choose whichever modifier you think is most
appropriate for this type of monster. For exam-
ple, :an ogre that is Much La.rger Than Normal
wo ul d take the + 3 modifier.
These modifiers arc: similar to ability modi-
fiers for characters. They arc used in the follow-
ing manner:
```

Age
Consider the average number of hit points per
Hit Die as a renection of a monster 's age. A new-
born creature would have I hit poim per Hir Die
```
(the minimum) and grad uall y gains more hit
```
```
points as it :~ges. The average sco re (4 1 /z points
```
```
per die on the average) is reached at the prime of
```
```
life: a mature. well-developed creature just ap-
```
proaching middle age for its race. After that
point, hit points usually decline. reaching as few
```
as twice the minimum (newborn) hit points. De-
```
feated monsters should only be wonh their full,
li sted XP va lue when at full adult hit points: yo u
can reduce the XP value when a monster is too
young or too old to have full hit points.
Mon ster s ize also often varies by age. begin-
ning at 10·25% of adult size a nd shrinking to
90% of adult size in old age.
Environmental Variations
Monsters may easily be adapted to different
environments. Under water. for example, play·
ers would expect the usual p reda tors fish.

co usi ns, but with a few diffe ren ces suitable for
the ir adaptation to the new environment.
The OM might dctidc to allow spec ial water·
breathing creatures to ven ture into new territory
only when conditions permit them to s urvive
normally. Dense fog. pouring rain, deep sn ow,
or other wet weather conditions might permit
water creatures to be found wandering nearly
anywhere. Snow sharks. their fins breaking
through the drifts, might prove quite haurdous

cr. their tendrils Hailing down in the rain. snag·

Remember that in adapting monsters to new
conditions, the OM is nOt bound by the limits of
our normal world. But the DM should try to find
logi ca l reasons within the framework of the fan·
t asy world for wh y and how these unusual si tu a·
tions come about. Although it may be easier to
just toss things in without worrying about rca·
sons or co nse quen ces, "rational famasy" can
provide much more entertainment all around.
Monster Spellcasters
The usc of magical spe lls is not limited to hu-
mans and e lv es. Man y humanoid races hav e their
own magic-users, clerics, and even druids. A
nonhuman cleric or druid is known as a shaman,
and a nonhuman magic-user as a wokan. Sha·
mans and wokani do not kn ow all the usual
spe lls. The spells they do know th ey often cast in
an unusual manner. involving dancing.
shouts and howls, and waving strange items.
The nonhuman spe ll castcrs that are known
```
are listed bel ow (und er " Maximum Spc ll castcr

```

```
tainablc by each. So me individuals may be
```
both classes (a shaman l wokan), but then the
```
maximum level for c:ach class is then half what
is li sted.
Note that most nonhumans in a tribe or lair
kn ow nothing of magi c, and may fear or distrust
```
it ; only the rare shamans and wokani kn ow how
```
to usc: it. These spe ll cas ters often usc their skills
to rise to positions of power within their tribe s.
Only one nonh uman in 20 is a spe ll caster, and
many groups have no wokani, only a shaman.
The spe lls usable by shamans and wokani arc
```
listed below (under "Spells Usable by Shamans"
```
```
and "Spells Usable by Wokani"). Shamans and
```
wokani do not know. and cannot learn, spells
other than these. Shamans and wokani cannot
read scroll s, but may usc other magical items. A
```
shaman can use any clerical item ; a wokan can
```
usc any item usable by a magic-user.
A shaman or wokan normally has 3·8 hit
```
points per Hit Die (ld6 +2 instead of IdS), and
```
gains a + 1 hit point bonus per spcllcaster expe-

Special Monster Spellcasters
Lycanthropcs
A lyamluopc: may be a real magic- user, cleric,
or druid in human form . However. it may not
usc any spells while in were -form and. when it
assumes were-form. most lose all memory of
spells learned, as if all the spells had been cast. A
devil swine spellcastcr can cast three charm per·
son spells per day in either were or human form ,
but can only cast other spells while in human
form. Devil swine will not forget spells wh ile in
were-form: When they return to human form,
all their memorized spells are sti ll with them.
Undead Spellcasters
A spcllcaster slain by an undead may retain
the usc of spells after returning as an undead.
Several undead spcllcastcrs arc listed above and
in the main Monster Li st.
```
If a cleric becomes a mummy (through a proc-
```
ess kn own only to the ancient high priests of cer-
```
tain religions), the undead mummy may usc
```
clerical spells to the full extent possessed in life,
```
and may co ntrol other undead as well (sec Lieges
```
```
and Pawns). A mummy magic-user is limited to
```
3rd level ability, even if it had higher level spell
usc in its previous life.
Undead Lieges and
Pawns
Under cenain conditions. inte lli gent undead
creatures can try to control other undead. The
undead need not be a spellcastcr to control or her
undead creatures.
An undead creature being controlled by an-
other is a pawn. An undead controlling one or
more lesser undead is a liege . Skeletons and
zombies can only be pawns, but any other type
of undead can be either a liege or a pawn. Ran-
dom encounters with undead may occasio nally
```
(10% chance) be with pawns controlled by a
```
greater undead creature.
A liege may control a number of undead
whose tOtal Hit Dice arc less than or equal to
rwice rhe liege's Hit Di ce. If an aucmpt by the
liege ro control or her undead would cause rhc tO·

tal ro exceed this amount, the aucmpr automati·
cally fails.
When a lich or other undead spellcastcr seeks
ro conuol other undead, its spellcurer level is
used instead of its Hit Dice. Like a magic-user,
a lich is far more powerful rhan its Hit Di ce in-
dicate.
Procedure
If an undead uies to control a potential pawn ,
the target may have no more than half the Hit
```
Di ce of the liege. (This docs nor apply in ce nain
```
```
situations; sec below .) lf the subject is already
```
controlled by any means. rhe undead auempt·
ing cont rol instantly recognizes this fact. It may
still attempt control, but with a -4 penalty to
the roll.
If one undead tries to control another, find
the Hit Dice of the would-be liege and potential
pawn on the following table, and roll 2d6. If the
number rolled is equal to or greater than the
number given on the table, the attempt succeeds
and the undead subject becomes the pawn of the
```
conuo llcr. A total of 2 or less (possib le if the roll
```
```
is penalized) always indicates failure.
```
If the undead auempting conuol was once a
spell-using character and can now usc spells as it
did in life. a + 2 bonus applies ro all die rolls to
control other undead.
During melee. an auempt ro gain conuol is
considered a combat action.
If an undead creates another of the same type
by slaying a living creature, the new undead is
autOmatically a pawn of the sl:aycr if the slayer
wants it to be. Spectres, vampires. wights, and
wraiths arc the only undead with this ability.
This may force the creator to release other exist·
```
ing pawns; if so. the pawns with the highest Hit
```
Dice arc released first. An undead would be wise
to re lease a less-important pawn before the new
```
pawn rises as an undead monster; that way. he
```
can keep the pawns he wants .
If an undead can ca ll or sum mon others, those
responding arc automatically its pawns unless
the new Hit Di ce total would exceed the limits
given above, or unless the liege allows them to
retain free will.

Benefits to a Liege
A liege is telepathically linked ro its pawns
and can sec and hear through t.hcm whenever it
chooses. This communication is ar will and need
nor be continuous.
Conuol of a pawn is rotal, even to the point
that it will obey suicidal orders: pawns obey
without hesitation. The maximum range of con-
```
uol is 24 miles (one outdoor map hex) per Hit
```
Die of the liege.
If a pawn fails a morale check and flees from
combat, the liege may srop the pawn and force ir
back into melee. This can be the only action the
liege takes during that melee round. The pawn
will miss at least one full round of attacks.
A liege can create a chain of control by in-
structi ng its pawns to become lieges too. For ex-
ample, a spectre could control up to 12 wights,
who co uld each control up to six skeletons. Di -
rect co mmunication and control docs not extend
through a chain of control, but only to a liege's
personal pawns.
Any liege may coordinate the attacks of its
pawns in a well-organized fashion. A liege at the
top of a chain of control that consists of ten or
```
more undead (counting the entire chain) may be
```
considered the Leader of an undead army. When
applying the War Machine mass combat system
```
(sec Chapter 9) note the following details for cal-

dom as equal to its Intelligence, and treat

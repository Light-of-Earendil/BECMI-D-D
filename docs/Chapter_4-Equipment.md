Characters who throw themselves into dangerous situations tend to survive a lot longer
if they have the right tools and equipment for
each situation. In this chapter, we list most of
the normal equipment characters will need in a
game.
Money
Some quick notes on money in the D&D®
game:
Starting Gold: Beginning characters receive a
one-time sum of 3d6 x 10 gold pieces. This represents money saved up by the character before
he embarked on his adventuring career, or
money given to him by his family before he left
home. It should be spent on weapons, armor,
and equipment; the DM may have recommendations as to what the characters should buy.
When first created, the character also can be assumed to own two or three sets of plain clothes, a
pair of shoes, a belt, and a belt-pouch.
Abbreviations: The game commonly uses the
following abbreviations.
platinum pieces = pp
gold pieces = gp
electrum pieces = ep
silver pieces = sp
copper pieces = cp
Conversions: You can convert money from one
type to another using the following values.
1 sp = 10 cp
1 ep = 5 sp = 50 cp
1 gp = 2 ep = 10 sp = 100 cp
1 pp = 5 gp = 10 ep = 50 sp = 500 cp
Weapons
Most characters will want to carry one or more
reliable weapons. The Weapons Table shows the
weapons available in the D&D game. Some of
these weapons have special effects that are Some
of the weapons in the table will look very similar
to one another. But these weapons often demonstrate substantial differences if you also use the
optional weapon mastery rules described in the
next chapter.
Weapon information in the table is defined as
follows:
• Item gives the weapon's name.
• Damage shows the amount of damage the
weapon does; if the column shows "1d6,"
for instance, you'd roll 1d6, for a result of 1
to 6 points of damage whenever you hit
with that weapon.
• Range shows the range characteristics of the
weapon if it fires projectiles or can be
thrown. A number like "60/120/180," for
example, means that the weapon is at short
range (for the indicated +1 to attack roll
modifier) from 1' to 60'; it is at medium
range (for no attack roll modifier) from 61'
to 120'; and it is at long range (for a - 1 to
attack roll modifier) from 121' to 180'. Beyond 180', it cannot hit a target. These distances are measured as feet indoors and as
yards outdoors; for example, a crossbow
that can fire 180' inside a dungeon can
launch its quarrel 180 yards outside.
• Cost (gp) shows how much it costs to buy
the weapon in gold pieces (gp).

' Enc (cn) shows how much encumbrance the
weapon has, measured in coin-weights (cn).
One coin weighs one-tenth of a pound. Remember that the more encumbrance a character is carrying, the slower he moves. *
 Notes refers you to the description section
that describes weapon characteristics. Sometimes a weapon that looks unimpressive on
the chart will have special features listed in
the Notes column, and those special features might make them very useful weapons
indeed.
Ammunition
Missile weapons such as bows eventually run
out of ammunition; here's what it costs to buy
additional ammunition.
These figures apply for any type of weapon
that goes by the name shown. Arrows cost the
same, come in the same standard loads, and
have the same encumbrance for a short bow as
for a long bow; darts for a short blowgun are
identical to those for a long blowgun.
Silver-tipped arrows and quarrels are like ordinary missiles, except that their arrowheads are
made of silver, which is useful when fighting certain monsters. Such arrows are comparatively expensive and are usually sold by the arrow, rather
than in batches of 20 or 30. Likewise, silver pellets are made for slings.
Arrow and quarrel costs include the price of a
cheap quiver or case, both of which carry a standard load of ammunition.
Weapon Descriptions
The weapons from the Weapons Table are described here. They are listed in alphabetical order for convenience.
Axe, Battle: This is a large one- or two-bladed
chopping head fixed upon a long (3'-5') wooden
shaft. This is a two-handed weapon; the wielder
of the weapon may not use a shield and always
loses individual initiative to characters not using
a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use this weapon.
Axe, Hand: This is a small chopping blade
(usually only one blade) affixed to a small (l'-2')
wooden shaft. It is a one-handed weapon and
may be thrown.
Bastard Sword: See Sword, Bastard (below).
Battle Axe: See Axe, Battle (above).
Blackjack: This weapon is a small leather sack,
4"-8" long, filled with sand or metal shot and
with a looped strap attached. It causes little
damage (1d2 points) but, if it is used to strike a
victim's head or neck, it can possibly stun or
cause unconsciousness.
This weapon has no effect on a victim wearing
a metal helmet (which is included in any set of
plate, banded, chain, or scale mail) or on any
unarmored monster of armor class 0 or less
(which indicates very tough skin or protective
plating).
The DM decides whether or not someone using a blackjack can hit his target's head. The DM
might decide, for example, that someone who
has sneaked up on a completely unsuspecting
target can aim at the target's head with no penalty, or that the character, in combat, can aim at
the enemy's head by taking a - 4 penalty to the
attack roll. Also at the DM's discretion, if the
target is so much taller than the attacker that the
attacker can't reach his head, then the attack can
only inflict normal damage.
If the attack does hit the target's head, consult
the Weapon Special Effects Table. The victim
must make a saving throw vs. death ray (possibly
with a bonus; see the table). If he fails the saving
throw, he suffers the additional effects shown on
the table, as determined by his Hit Dice. These
effects are as follows:
Knockout: The victim is immediately unconscious and remains helpless for dl00 (d%)
rounds.
Stun: The victim is stunned and will remain
stunned until he successfully makes a saving
throw vs. death ray. He may try to make a new
saving throw each round.
Delay: The victim is mildly dazed; he loses
initiative on the next round.
Blowgun: This weapon is a tube, 6"-4' long.
The user places a small dart or thorn into it, aims
the tube at a target, and blows air into it—
forcing the dart to fly toward the target.
The darts cause no damage themselves. However, the darts are usually treated with poison. A
blowgun dart merely scratches the victim, with
little penetration; it inflicts no real damage. If
hit, the victim must make a saving throw vs. poison or suffer the effects. Depending on the size
or level of experience of the victim, he may gain
a bonus to the saving throw (see the Weapon
Special Effects Table). No undead creature or
any creature immune to poison can be harmed
by a blowgun.
The use of deadly poison as a weapon is not a
good act. Because of its dangers, poison may be
declared illegal by local or regional rulers. In this
case, Lawful characters do not typically use it.
The DM may choose not to allow player characters to use poisons in his campaign. Warn players
that, if they want their characters to use blowguns, monsters will have them as well.
Longer blowguns are two-handed weapons;
the wielder of the weapon may not use a shield
and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings
and small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use
this weapon.
Bola: This weapon is a cord with weighted
balls on the ends. It is whirled around and
thrown at a victim. It causes very little damage
itself (1d2 points), but may entangle, slow, or
delay the victim.
If the attack roll is a 20 (not counting any
modifiers), the victim must make a saving throw
vs. death ray or be immediately paralyzed; he
will die in ld6 + 2 (3-8) rounds from strangling
unless rescued. If freed, the victim remains effectively paralyzed for 2d6 (2-12) rounds. Creatures that do not breathe (such as constructs) are
immune to this effect.
If the attack roll is successful but not a 20, the
victim must make a saving throw vs. death ray,
possibly with a bonus (see the Weapon Special
Effects Table). If the saving throw is successful,
the attack has no effect except damage. If the
victim fails the saving throw, the result varies by
the victim's experience level or size (see the
Weapon Special Effects Table).
The victim may try to make a new saving
throw during the hand-to-hand combat phase of
each round until one is successful; this indicates
that the victim has removed the bola. If another
character tries to remove the bola that has struck
a victim, the victim rolls his own saving throw vs.
death ray, with a +2 bonus. When the victim
makes the saving throw, the bola is removed.
The victim may spend 1 round destroying the
bola if he has an edged weapon and chooses to
destroy it. Otherwise, the bola is undamaged; he
can hold on to it or drop it.
Possible bola effects, as listed on the Weapon
Special Effects Table, are as follows:
Entangle: The victim cannot attack, cast
spells, or move until his saving throw is successfully made.
Slow: The victim is slowed, moving and attacking at half his normal rate; he cannot cast
spells.
Delay: The victim automatically loses individual initiative for the next round.
This weapon can only affect solid creatures.
Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, and monsters made of water (such as a water elemental)
cannot be affected.
Bolas are awkward to carry and may become
tangled. For each additional bola carried, the encumbrance of the bolas triples: 1 bola = 5 en, 2
bolas = 15 en, 3 bolas = 45 en, etc.
Bow, Long: This is a piece of wood bent into a
curve, with a taut string holding it in that position; it is used to launch arrows.
This bow is a two-handed weapon; the wielder
of the weapon may not use a shield and always
loses individual initiative to characters not using
a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small races
such as goblins cannot use this weapon.
Bow, Short: This bow is similar to the long
bow, but it is smaller and not able to fire arrows
as far. It, too, is a two-handed weapon, but it can
be used by halfling characters and small races
such as goblins.
Cestus: The cestus (plural: cesti) is a sort of
glove or thong wrapped around the hand; it has
rough, cutting edges on the back, so that a
punching attack will inflict more damage on an
opponent. If the campaign uses the optional
rules for two-weapons use, a character does not
suffer the — 4 penalty for the cestus worn on his
offhand.
Club: This is a simple, blunt piece of wood
used to batter opponents.
Crossbow, Heavy: This is a missile weapon
consisting of a tough bow (like a small bow, but
smaller and sometimes made of metal) laid crosswise across a stock with a trigger. It fires stubby
arrows called quarrels.
Heavy crossbows are bulky, requiring two
hands to use, and are slow to reload. A character
with 18 strength can draw back the string with
one hand and fire every round, but weaker characters must point the crossbow nose-down on the
ground, brace it with one foot, and draw back
the string with both hands in order to reload it;
they can only fire it once every two rounds.
This crossbow is a two-handed weapon; the
wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and
always loses individual initiative to characters
not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and
small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use this
weapon.
Crossbow, Light: This weapon is similar to the
heavy crossbow, but smaller. It also requires two
hands to load, but only one to fire.
This crossbow is a two-handed weapon; the
wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and
always loses individual initiative to characters
not using a two-handed weapon. Halfling characters and small races such as goblins cannot use
this weapon.
Dagger: This is a small blade with a onehanded grip. It may be used in hand-to-hand
combat or thrown. Some expensive varieties are
made out of silver for use against certain magical
creatures.
Halberd: See Polearms, Halberd (below).
Hammer, Throwing: This is a short-shafted,
broad-headed hammer, capable of crushing
blows. It is balanced for throwing.
Hammer, War: This weapon consists of a
broad hammer head—sometimes with two striking ends instead of just one—on a mediumlength (about 3') wooden shaft.
Hand Axe: See Axe, Hand (above).
Heavy Crossbow: See Crossbow, Heavy
(above).
Holy Water: This is water that has been prepared by a special cleric (who must be at least 9th
level or above). It is normally placed into a
breakable bottle or gourd and then hurled at a
target; if it strikes the target, the container
smashes and the target is splashed.
Holy water only does the listed damage to undead monsters; all other characters and monsters
are unaffected by it (except for being dampened).
If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery
rules (in the next chapter), all characters have
Basic mastery level when using holy water.
Horned Shield: See Shield Weapons, Horned
Shield (below).
Javelin: This weapon is a thrusting point atop
a light, long (4'-6') pole. Characters can throw it
at targets or use it in hand-to-hand combat; in
hand-to-hand, they can use it with one hand,
keeping the other hand free for a shield or weapon. Halflings (and small races such as goblins)
can use this weapon.
Knife Shield: See Shield Weapons, Knife
Shield (below).
Lance: When in combat on horseback, many
fighters use a special long spear called a lance.
Fighters, dwarves, and elves can use the Lance Attack maneuver (see Chapter 8). Mystics can use
lances, though they do not have the Lance Attack
combat maneuver; even when on the back of a
charging horse, mystics always thrust with the
weapon as though fighting with a spear. Other
human classes cannot use a lance effectively.
A character with a lance may still use a shield;
however, if you are using the optional Weapon
Mastery rules (in the next chapter), a character
who is at Basic mastery with the lance cannot yet
use a shield. Under the Weapon Mastery rules, a
lance can be used to gain a defense bonus, but
each round a lance is used to defend, it causes
only half damage.
If the wielder of the lance has the Multiple Attacks option, he can indeed make multiple attacks, but not all against the same foe. He must !
make each attack against a different target, taking them in the course of his lance charge.
A lance used from the back of a flying mount
can be used normally. If the wielder needs to release the lance and ties it to his saddle so that it I
will not drop to the ground, he cannot defend 1
with it.
Light Crossbow: See Crossbow, Light (above).
Long Bow: See Bow, Long (above).
Mace: This is a heavy striking head attached to
a short- or medium-length wooden shaft.
Net: A net is an open mesh of rope or cord.
Small nets (up to 10' x 10') are commonly used
in hunting and adventuring and can be used as
either a hand-to-hand or thrown weapon. The
net's encumbrance varies by the size.
This weapon is commonly available in most
campaign worlds. Its cost is low, but it is easily
damaged. The net is one of humankind's first
tools, having been invented in prehistoric times,
and it is used by most humanoid monsters for
both hunting and defense.
A net can only affect creatures made of solid
material. Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures,
and monsters made of water (such as water elementals) cannot be affected.
A net inflicts no damage on the victim, but
may entangle, slow, or delay the victim. The
wielder makes a normal roll to hit his target; if
he does, the target must make a saving throw vs.
death ray, possibly with a bonus (see the Weapon
Special Effects Table).
If the saving throw succeeds, the net does not
affect the target; it drops off him without impairing him at all. If the victim fails his saving
throw, the result varies by the victim's experience level or size.
Once a target is trapped in a net, he may make
a new saving throw during the hand-to-hand
combat phase of each round until one is successful; a successful roll indicates that the net has
been pulled off and thrown aside. If he has a
dagger (but not a longer weapon or a nonbladed
weapon) in his hand when he is hit with the net,
he has a +4 to his saving throw; success means
that he has cut his way out of the net, thus destroying it.

** Or equivalent in square feet.
Magical nets are rare. The few that exist cannot be damaged except by fire or acid; daggers
will not cut through them. An entangled victim
can only remove the net, not damage it.
The effects listed on the Weapon Special Effects Table are as follows:
Entangle: The victim cannot attack, cast
spells, or move until a saving throw is successful.
Slow: The victim is slowed, moving and attacking at half his normal rate. He cannot cast
spells.
Delay: The victim automatically loses initiative for the next round.
A net can easily be damaged by any edged
weapon (or claw or bite), but it can be repaired if
rope or cord is available, which requires 1d3
turns of undisturbed repair work. A damaged
net is useless.
Nets come in a variety of sizes; if the target is
too large for the net, he will gain bonuses to his
saving throw to avoid the effects. Using the Nets
Table, determine how many sizes the victim is
larger than the net. For each size greater, the victim gains a +4 bonus. A roll of 1 is always a failure unless the bonus is + 20 or greater.
Nets 6' x 6' or smaller may be used onehanded. Larger nets require two hands and suffer the same penalties as other two-handed
weapons. The wielder may not use a shield, always loses individual initiative to characters not
using a two-handed weapon; and halflings and
small nonhumans (such as goblins) cannot use
nets larger than 6' x 6'.
Normal Sword: See Sword, Normal (below).
Oil, Burning: This type of weapon usually
consists of cooking or lamp oil poured into a
breakable container (such as a bottle, gourd, or
glass lamp), with a fuse or wick attached. In
combat, the wielder lights the fuse or wick and
throws it at his target (lighting and throwing only takes one round if the character has another lit
object handy). If the container hits the target, it
bursts, splashes the target with the oil, and ignites the oil on target.
Burning oil causes 1d8 points of damage each
round a target is in the fire. Oil that has been lit
and thrown will burn for 2 rounds. If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery rules (next
chapter), all characters are considered to have
Basic mastery level with thrown containers of
burning oil.
Pike: See Polearms, Pike (below).
Polearms: Polearms consist of various weapon
blades mounted on long poles. Polearms may be
used only by fighters, dwarves, elves, and mystics. Because of a polearm's length, a character
with a polearm may attack a foe even when there
is another friend or foe between them. Often,
polearm wielders stand in the second rank of the
combat, striking over the heads of their frontline comrades to hit front-line fighters of the enemy force.
A polearm may be used with the Fighter Combat options. However, the optional disarm rule
may only be used where noted with the weapon
type.
The polearm user's attack rolls suffer penalties
of — 3 for each of the following cases:
• The user is a dwarf.
• The wielder is attacking from behind a larger ally.
• An ally in front of the user is using a twohanded weapon (other than a polearm) or any
weapon that is swung backward behind the
wielder (e.g., a battle axe, bola, sling, etc.), thus
endangering the polearm bearer.
If you are using the Weapon Mastery rules
from the next chapter, characters trained in the
use of these two-handed weapons can deflect attacks with them.
Four types of pole arms are shown on the
Weapons Table. They have individual entries because each has certain characteristics that distinguish it from the others when using the Weapon
Mastery rules. The variations are as follows:
Halberd: This weapon is both a thrusting and
a chopping weapon. It has a broad axehead with
a spike on the top and a hook on the back.
Pike: This thrusting weapon (essentially an
extra-long spear) has a short, sharp spearhead on
the end of a very long pole (12-18').
Poleaxe: This chopping weapon has a small
axehead attached to a pole of varying length (5-
15'). It is essentially an extra-long battle axe.
Polearm: All other polearms use this line on
the Weapons Table. A character using a polearm
can say that it is a generic polearm, or he can say
that he is using one of the following specific
types of real-world polearms:
• Bardiche: This weapon has a heavy axe
blade with a long spike projecting forward.
• Bill: A lightweight weapon, the bill has a
long, narrow, single-edged blade (like a scythe).
• Gisarme: This weapon resembles a bill with
a thin spike on the back of the blade, curving
forward.
• Glaive: This weapon has a broad, knifelike
blade.
• Lochaber Axe: This weapon has a long,
heavy, single-bladed axe with a hook on the
back, pointing forward.
• Partizan: The partizan has a broad spearhead with two hooks at the base, pointing forward.
• Ranseur: This weapon has a short, sharp
spike flanked by two short, curved blades at its
base.
• Spetum: The spetum has a long spike with
two sharp curved blades forming a trident shape.
• Spontoon: The spontoon has an elaborate
blade, possibly wavy or with flares.
• Voulge: The voulge has a large, heavy,
broad blade like a cleaver.
In the campaign, a DM can simply use the generic polearm entry on the Weapons Table for
polearm variants. Or, if he's using the Weapon
Mastery rules, he can follow the guidelines in
that chapter for combining the traits of halberds, pikes, and polearms into new weapons.
Regardless of type, all polearms are twohanded weapons; the wielder of the weapon may
not use a shield and always loses individual initiative to characters not using a two-handed
weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans (such
as goblins) cannot use this weapon.
Poleaxe: See Polearms, Poleaxe (above).
Rock, Thrown: This is a rock of fist size or
smaller. When a character throws any object that
causes impact damage, treat it as if it were a
thrown rock; the DM can reduce the damage
done if he thinks it is not as punishing as a normal rock. Strength modifications apply to attack
rolls and damage.
If you are using the optional Weapon Mastery
rules, all characters are considered to have Basic
mastery level with thrown rocks.
Shield Weapons: These weapons combine a
shield with weapon blades. Though awkward
and prone to breaking, a shield weapon can provide a second attack when used with a one-
handed weapon. Only fighters, thieves, and
demihumans may use these weapons. Monsters
rarely use shield weapons.
The larger shield weapons may break during
battle. Check for breakage whenever the attacker
or the defender rolls the exact attack roll needed.
(For example, if a roll of 9 or better is needed to
hit and a 9 is rolled on the die, check for breakage.) Each time a breakage occurs, one of the
shield weapon's blades becomes unusable.
The chance that a shield weapon will break is
5 or less on 1d10. Magical shield bonuses add to
the die roll, and magical weapon bonuses of the
foe subtract from it. In addition to magical modifiers, modify the foe's attack roll by - 1 per 10
points of maximum damage possible.
For example, a fighter with a sword shield + 3
is attacked by a monster using a two-handed
sword. The monster needs a 7 to hit his target
(before any modifications), and he rolls a 7 on
the die. The wielder of the sword shield must
check for breakage.
The shield wielder's base roll is 1d10; on a 5 or
less his shield breaks. His roll will have a -1
penalty because his opponent's two-handed
sword can do up to 10 points of damage. But he
will have a bonus of +3 because his shield is
magical. He rolls a 6, which yields 6 - 1 + 3 = 8.
His shield doesn't break.
The four types of shield weapons are as follows:
Horned Shield: A one-foot circular shield that
is strapped to the arm rather than held. A single
spike projects from its center. This shield is very
durable and will not break.
Knife Shield: A small buckler equipped with
one or two short blades protruding from its
sides.
Sword Shield: A medium-size shield with one
or two sword or spear blades projecting from the
sides (if round) or ends (if oblong).
Tusked Shield: A large shield with one to four
short blades protruding from the sides. It may
have a central spike. Due to its size, the tusked
shield requires two hands to use and may not be
used with an additional weapon or another
shield. Characters using this weapon always lose
individual initiative to characters not using a
two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use this weapon.
Short Bow: See Bow, Short (above).
Short Sword: See Sword, Short (below).
Sling: This is a length of cord or a long leather
strap with a pouch in the middle. The user places a stone or metal "bullet" in the pouch, holds
the sling by the ends, whirls it to build up speed,
and then releases one end of the strap to launch
the missile at his target.
Spear: The spear is a thrusting head attached
to one end of a medium-to-long pole (6'-8').
Fighters, dwarves, elves, and mystics can use the
set spear vs. charge maneuver (see Chapter 8).
Staff: This is a 2" -thick staff, 4'-6' long, possibly with iron-loaded ends. A staff may be used
by all classes, even by magic-users if the DM so
permits.
The staff is a two-handed weapon; the wielder
of the weapon may not use a shield and always
loses individual initiative to characters not using
a two-handed weapon. Halflings and small nonhumans cannot use this weapon.
Stone: See Rock, Thrown (above).
Sword, Bastard: This popular weapon is similar to a normal sword (below) but has a longer
blade and a hilt (handle) nearly as long as that of
a two-handed sword; the overall weapon length
may be from 3 1/2' to 4 1/2'. The sword may be
wielded either one- or two-handed.
A character cannot use a shield while using
this item two-handed. However, it does not
cause the loss of individual initiative. The bastard sword cannot be used by a halfling or other
small humanoid.
Sword, Normal: This is the classic weapon of
fantasy. It consists of a one-handed hilt (handle)
attached to a long cutting or thrusting blade; the
weapon is usually between 2"/2(
 to 3 1/2' long.
Sword, Short: This is much like the normal
sword (above) but smaller; it is usually between
2' to 2 1/2' long. Halflings and small nonhumans
such as goblins can use this weapon.
Sword, Two-Handed: This weapon, also called
the great sword, is the largest type of sword. It is
similar to the normal sword (above) but much
longer, usually being 4 1/2' to 6 1/2' long.
This sword is a two-handed weapon; the
wielder of the weapon may not use a shield and
always loses individual initiative to characters
not using a two-handed weapon. Halflings and
small nonhumans such as goblins cannot use this
weapon.
Sword Shield: See Shield Weapons, Sword
Shield (above).
Throwing Hammer: See Hammer, Throwing
(above).
Torch: A torch is basically a flaming club. Although lighter than a club, it is on fire so it does
the same amount of damage as a club (ld4). If
someone uses an unlit torch as a bludgeoning
weapon, it does 1d2 points of damage.
If you use the optional Weapon Mastery rules,
mastery with a club is also mastery with a torch.
However (also from the Weapon Mastery rules),
someone unskilled with a torch does not halve
damage, but always inflicts 1d4 points (regardless if the torch is lit).
Trident: This is a light spear with three barbed
prongs on the end, designed for underwater use.
Any small creatures (2' long or less, such as normal fish) hit by a trident become stuck on the
spiked prongs. To free themselves, they need to
make an ability check vs. Strength to free themselves. They may make one attempt per round;
many small creatures have Strengths that do not
exceed 1 or 2.
This weapon can be used either one- or twohanded. Used two-handed, it operates similarly
to other two-handed weapons (i.e., the wielder
cannot use a shield when using the weapon this
way). However, a character using this weapon,
even in its two-handed style, does not lose his
initiative roll, and halflings and other small creatures can use this weapon.
Tusked Shield: See Shield Weapons, Tusked
Shield (above).
Two-Handed Sword: See Sword, Two-Handed
(above).
War Hammer: See Hammer, War (above).
Whip: This weapon is a long, braided leather
strap with a handle. It may be from 5'-30' long.
It is a hand-to-hand weapon and may be used to
either cause damage (1d2 points) or to entangle.
Before each combat round, the user must declare
which option is being used. Whichever he uses,
he makes a normal attack roll.
If he scores a hit, the whip either inflicts ld2
points of damage or (if entangling is attempted)
forces the victim to make a saving throw vs.
death ray, possibly with a bonus. (See the Weapon Special Effects Table for his saving throw bonus and the result of the attack.) If the victim
fails his saving throw, he may be entangled,
slowed, or delayed.
The effects listed on the Weapon Special Effects Table are as follows:
Entangle: The victim cannot attack, cast
spells, or move until a saving throw is successful.
Slow: The victim is slowed, moving and attacking at half his normal rate. He cannot cast
spells.
Delay: The victim automatically loses initiative for the next round.
This weapon is not very useful except as a tactical device. It is most often used by a thief or
other character who wants to help a front-line
fighter somehow while not actually engaging in
melee.
A whip can only entangle creatures made of
solid material. Wraiths, spectres, ethereal creatures, and monsters made of water (such as water
elementals) cannot be entangled. They will,
however, suffer the normal damage caused by a
whip. (A normal whip will not hit a monster that
can only be hit by magical weapons, of course;
that would require a magical whip.)
Nonstandard Weapon Use
(Optional)
Sometimes a character may want to use a onehanded weapon with two hands. This inflicts
more damage, but has the following limitations:
• Any one-handed weapon (except "Other
Weapons") can be used for this option.
• The character loses individual initiative.
• The character cannot effectively use a shield
for defense while wielding a weapon twohanded (no AC bonus).
When used two-handed, weapons gain an additional +1 point of damage to their attacks.
This bonus applies to any one-handed weapons
used with both hands, regardless of the original
damage of the weapon. Therefore, a dagger used
in this way inflicts ld4 + 1 (2-5) points of damage, and a spear does ld6 + l (2-7) points of
damage when wielded with both hands.
Armor
All fighters, clerics, dwarves, elves, and halflings can use any of the types of armor described
below. Thieves and druids can use the types of
armor indicated in the "Notes" column. Magicusers and mystics can use none of these armor
types.
Armor is normally made for a specific race.
The DM can impose penalties on a character who wears the armor of a different race. For example,
an elf would find a dwarf's chain mail awkward
and heavy (for an additional reduction to movement beyond what the armor's encumbrance
calls for), a halfling would find it very hard to
move in a human's armor (he would have to save
vs. paralysis each round to avoid tripping and
falling down), and a dwarf couldn't get into a
halfling's armor at all!
Armor Descriptions
Each type of armor constitutes a full set. The
player can presume that his character, as part of the
set of armor, gets the type of headgear appropriate
to the armor (e.g., from a stout leather cap to a full
metal helm). The player may imagine other appropriate armor components as he chooses—gauntlets,
vambraces, greaves, etc.—as these components do
not affect play or armor class.
The armor listed in the Armor Table is described here and is presented alphabetically for
your convenience.
Banded Mail: This is a suit of heavy leather armor with strips or knobs of metal imbedded in
the leather.
Chain Mail: This is a full-sized shirt, often including a hood and sometimes including full
pants, made of interlocked rings of metal. It is
worn over a quilted shirt called a gambeson.
When someone with a heavy weapon hits a character in chain mail, the gambeson keeps the
chain mail's links from being driven into the
flesh. (Additionally, it keeps him from being
chilled by flesh-to-metal contact in cool weather
and from being pinched by the rings.)
Leather Armor: This armor is made of tough
leather, often boiled for extra toughness, or even
boiled in wax (which produces armor known as
cuir-boulli).
Plate Mail: This is not the full plate armor
usually associated with knights. It consists of numerous metal plates (the chestplate being the
most important of them) linked together by
chain mesh; it's much like the chain mail armor
described above except that it has large, shaped
metal plates reinforcing it.
Scale Mail: This armor consists of light leather
armor completely covered with overlapping
metal scales sewn or riveted onto the leather.
Shield: A shield can be any of a number of
sizes as follows:
• Target or Buckler (a small round shield,
with only one strap, held in the fighter's hand);
• Medium or Round (a larger, heavier shield,

often with two straps—one for the fighter's hand
and one further up on his forearm); or
• Wall or Tower (a huge shield nearly the size
of the wielder, usually with two straps like a Medium).
Regardless of size, all shields provide the same
amount of protection by lowering the armor class
score by — 1. Smaller shields are considered easier to move into the path of danger, while larger
shields protect better but are slower to move into
the path of danger—thus the benefit is evenly
divided.
Suit Armor: Suit armor is the type of armor associated with the mounted knights of high romance.
It encloses the wearer completely in a sheath of
steel, with chain-link joints to permit movement. It
is often called plate armor (which is different than
plate mail), full plate, gothic armor, or jousting armor. However, suit armor is more like the plate armor made during the last days of armor-making.
The arrival of gunpowder forced armor-makers to
thicken the armor made, which rendered it too
heavy and clumsy and impractical for use, leading
to the abandonment of making armor. In the
D&D® game, the presence of magic has had almost
the same effect on suit armor.
Advantages: Suit armor alone is armor class 0.
It may be used with a shield for armor class — 1.
Suit armor reduces the damage inflicted by
most area effects (fire, cold, gas, acid), including
breath weapons. The base damage is reduced by
1 point per die of damage, and the wearer gains
a +2 bonus to the applicable saving throw. The
minimum base damage is always at least 1 point
per die.
For example, the damage from the breath of a
small red dragon (HD 10, 57 hit points) is reduced by 1 point per die of damage (- 10) to 47;
the fighter in suit armor may make the usual saving throw, but with a +2 bonus, to take half
damage (24 points).
Magical suit armor can reduce such damage
still further, by 1 point per die of damage for
each two pluses of enchantment (rounded
down).
If a fighter in suit armor is mounted and has
assistance from others, the disadvantages of encumbrance, slow movement, and surprise can be
minimized.
Disadvantages: Suit armor is bulky and expensive. Its encumbrance is 750 cn. It must be
specially made for one wearer, tailored exactly to
fit; the cost is 250 gp. Magical forms are proportionately more valuable, averaging 50% greater
value than plate mail of identical enchantment.
Suit armor is awkward in some situations, especially when getting up from a prone position
or mounting a steed. If attempted alone, the
chance of success is 1 in 6 per round. In late medieval times, the latter problem was solved by
the use of a strap tied around the wearer and
over a handy limb or bar. The knight was then
hoisted into the air and lowered onto the mount.
In the D&D game, assume automatic success in
getting up if anyone is available to help the wearer.
Suit armor is noisy and slow. Its common
creaks and clanks can be heard up to 120 feet
away and negate chances for surprise. The wearer's movement rate is 30' (10'); most fighters
prefer to use their suit armor only when fighting
from horseback.
An unarmored fighter needs two full turns to
dress in suit armor; it takes one full turn to take
it off.
Suit armor gives no additional protection
against gaze attacks (such as a medusa's) or electricity (such as a blue dragon's lightning breath).
The wearer has a - 5 penalty when using any
missile device other than a crossbow. If alone,
the wearer suffers a - 1 penalty to be surprised.
(In other words, a fighter in such armor rolling
for surprise might roll a 3, indicating no surprise, but the penalty applied will reduce the roll
to a 2, resulting in the fighter being surprised.)
Barding
Some characters purchase armor for their
horses so that their mounts, too, will be protected in combat.
Most of these types of barding correspond to
types of character armor. Chain barding, for example, is made up of the same material as a
character's chain mail. Joust barding is the horse
equivalent of suit armor. Field barding is similar
to joust barding, but lighter.
Barding and Encumbrance
On the Barding Encumbrance Table are the
types of mounts for which barding is usually
made. Note that one animal's barding will not
fit another type of animal, except that barding
made for a war horse will fit a draft horse and
vice versa.
Listed on the Barding Encumbrance Table is
the animal, its normal movement rate, the
amount of encumbrance it can carry at its normal
movement rate, and the amount of encumbrance it can carry up to half its movement rate.
If loaded with an amount of encumbrance
greater than the amount shown in the last
column, the beast will not move.
Remember that the encumbrance shown is the
total encumbrance being carried by the beast.
This includes the barding, the weight of the
rider(s) and all armor and gear. Encumbrance
rates for characters' gear is listed in the Adventuring Gear Table.
Barding for Other Animals (Optional)
The DM can allow characters to commission
barding for other creatures. If he does, here are
some rules for the DM to gauge the cost and encumbrance of barding made for other types of
creatures.
In Chapter 14, many creatures have a listing
titled "Load." This shows what sort of load the
creature can carry and with what modification to
its movement rate. (Not all creatures have this
information.) With many "Load" paragraphs is
a "Barding Multiplier." This is a number that
represents how much more difficult it is to make
barding for this creature and how much more
encumbered the creature will be with barding.
To determine how much it costs to make barding for any type of creature, take its barding cost
and encumbrance multiplier and multiply it by
the cost and encumbrance columns from the
Barding Table.
For example, a character wants to find the cost
and encumbrance of armor specially made for his
griffon. Take the cost and encumbrance values
from the Barding Table and then multiply them
by the barding cost and encumbrance multiplier
from the description of the griffon in Chapter
14. The griffon's multiplier is a x 5. The griffon's basic AC is 5, so it will need banded barding (or better) to improve its condition.
Multiplying the cost and encumbrance by 5, the
banded armor for a griffon would cost 2,000 gp
and have an encumbrance of 7,500 cn. The griffon's description says that it can fly with up to a
load of 7,000 cn at full speed or 14,000 cn at half
speed, so the griffon carrying this armor must be
reduced to half flying speed.
When barding provides an AC that is only
equal to or worse than the creature's natural AC,
it will do no good to wear the armor.
Adventuring Gear

characters take on adventures.

* This is the item's encumbrance when empty. When goods are placed within it, the encumbrance includes both the item's encumbrance and the encumbrance of the goods within it.
Thus, a fully filled belt pouch has an encumbrance of 55 cn.
** This is the encumbrance if packed. If the clothes are worn, disregard the encumbrance.
*** This is the quiver's encumbrance when empty. Filled with arrows or quarrels, it is up to 10 cn
for encumbrance. A 5-cn encumbrance quiver + 10 cn of missiles (20 arrows or 30 quarrels)
still equals only a 10-cn encumbrance bundle to carry around.
leather boots. Riding boots are more expensive
footwear coming up to the knee or just below.
Swash-topped boots are soft leather boots that
come up well above the knee, but the top portion folds down at knee height or below, resulting in a cuff.
Cloak: The D&D® game gives no special benefit to characters wearing cloaks, but the DM
may decide that a character caught in cold
weather without a cloak or similar garment could
eventually suffer from exposure.
Clothes: A character is presumed to start play
with two or three sets of clothes of the plain variety. Plain clothes are fine for most travel and adventuring purposes; the better grades of clothes
are for social purposes. (Characters invited to the
king's ball don't go in plain or middle-class
clothes, after all!)
Garlic: This is an aromatic herb that repels
vampires and some other undead monsters.
Grappling Hook: A large 3- or 4-pronged
hook, made of specially hardened iron, this item
is tied to the end of the rope and then swung up
or over a target. A successful attack roll, with difficulty modifiers as the DM decides, means that the
hook has anchored itself to the target. With use of
this tool, the characters can often cross gaps or
climb walls they could not otherwise climb. The
hook may also be attached manually to a nearby
surface, such as when a thief climbs a wall and
then attaches a line for his friends to climb.
Hammer: This is used to drive iron spikes into
hard surfaces. Used as a weapon, it does ld3
points of damage and can be wielded by anyone
who can use a war hammer.
Hat or Cap: This is standard headgear for the
campaign setting.
Holy Symbol: This is a sign or symbol of a cleric's beliefs. It is often used to physically ward off
vampires, and DMs may make holy symbols necessary for a cleric to turn undead.
Holy Water: This is water prepared by a high
level cleric. It will cause damage to undead monsters.
Iron Spikes: These are essentially large, long
iron nails; they may have flat heads or circular,
open heads (the latter kind is useful for tying
ropes to). Spikes can be used to wedge doors
open, provide grips for climbing or anchors for
ropes, pry things loose, and so forth. Characters
will need a hammer to pound them into hard
surfaces such as stone and wood.
Lantern: This is a simple oil lantern that casts
light in a 30' radius, burning one flask of oil in
four hours (24 turns). Most types are shuttered or
enclosed against wind.
Mirror: Your character can use a mirror to look
around corners, examine empty rooms, and defend against magical gaze attacks. When a character uses a mirror to watch an opponent, he
receives a - 2 penalty to attack rolls when he
tries to hit that target, and he cannot use a shield
(he's holding the mirror in his shield hand). The
area must be lit for the mirror to work this way.
Oil: Oil is burned in a lantern for light. A
flask of oil may also be thrown as a missile weapon or poured out and ignited to delay pursuit.
Pole, Wooden: This is the proverbial 10' pole,
made of wood 2" thick. Particularly cautious adventurers, or adventurers in regions where such
objects have proven their usefulness, use poles to
prod piles of rags, stir around in watery pools,
poke into corners, touch objects that may have
traps attached to them, test the sturdiness of
floors and ledges, and so forth.
Quiver: This is a container for arrows or quarrels; it is usually made of leather. A lesser-quality
quiver is included in the basic cost of a load of
ammunition, as noted on the Ammunition Table above.
Rations: Your character needs to pack food
and drink when traveling; rations are food that
has been packaged for travel. A single ration is
enough food to sustain one vigorous adult for a
week—that is, about 21 meals. Rations for adventurers typically come in two types as follows:
Standard Rations: These rations consist of untreated food chosen and prepared for traveling;
they will last up to a week when the characters
are traveling outdoors. Carried into a dank, unhealthy dungeon, they spoil overnight.
Iron Rations: These rations are preserved food
(beef jerky, hard tack, dried fruits and vegetables, etc.); they are not as tasty as standard rations, but they last for two months (eight weeks)
in normal travel and up to a week in bad conditions (such as dungeons).
Rope (50' Length): This is a heavy climbing
rope that can support three fully loaded humans
(i.e., about 7,500 cn in encumbrance). Rope can
be tied to an iron spike and used to climb up
steep walls. It may also be useful in tying up captured prisoners, pulling doors open, etc.
Sack, Large: This is a burlap, cloth, or leather
bag, usually 2' x 4'. It is normally carried over a
shoulder (occupying one hand) or tied onto a
cart or saddle-horn; if carried in hand, it is usually dropped when the owner goes into combat.
Sack, Small: Similar to a large sack, the 1' X 2'
cloth bag can be carried over the shoulder (occupying one hand) or tied onto a cart or a saddlehorn. Some characters tie it off their belts or
(with quick-release knots) to their spearheads.
Shoes: A character should have shoes if he is
going to travel or explore dungeons; the DM
might assign damage to barefoot characters
walking through bad terrain or treacherous catacombs.
Stakes and Mallet: Three large (18") wooden
stakes and a wooden mallet can be quite useful
for destroying vampires.
Thieves' Tools: Required for picking locks,
these items are usable only by thieves. A typical
set includes various lockpicks, fine wire, etc.
Tinderbox: The tinderbox is a small box containing flint, steel, and tinder (wood shavings).
Characters use this to start any fires, be it for
their camp or their torches. To use a tinderbox,
roll 1d6; under normal (comparatively dry) circumstances, a fire is successfully ignited on a result of 1 or 2. Someone with a tinderbox may try
to use it once per round.
Torch: This is any 1' to 2' long piece of wood,
its head sometimes covered with an inflammable
substance such as pitch. It casts light in a 30' radius and burns for one hour (six turns). See the
description from the Weapons Table for information on using a torch as a weapon; clerics can use
it as a weapon.
Waterskin: This flexible container is usually
made of leather or a preserved animal bladder. It
has a liquid capacity of one quart and an encumbrance of 30 cn when filled, 5 cn when empty.
Wine: This is the cost of a quart of common
wine, not including the container.
Wolfsbane: Sold dried or fresh in single sprigs,
this is an herb used to drive off lycanthropes,
who cannot abide its presence.
Land Transportation
Equipment
Characters usually acquire land animals, and
sometimes carts or wagons, for transportation of
themselves and their gear overland. Adventurers
typically buy the types of animals for transportation listed in the Riding Animal Costs Table. In
addition, they may purchase other equipment
from the Land Transportation Gear Table.
Riding Animal Descriptions
The animals listed in the Riding Animal Costs
Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your use.
Camels: These animals are normally only
found in desert campaigns. They are better suited to arid climates than horses, and they travel
much further on the same amount of water.
Horses: As campaigns develop, characters will
travel many miles in search of adventure. Most
characters will probably purchase one or more
horses to make travel faster and easier. Types of
horses are as follows:
Draft Horses: These horses are huge, plodding
animals usually used to plow fields and perform
other farm labors. Characters will seldom want
to ride them—normally this will occur only
when they need to transport an injured person or
a lot of gear and they have no other mount.
Riding Horses: This type of horse is the fastest
normal steed, but it is no help in combat.
War Horses: These horses are larger and hardier than riding horses, and they may be useful in
wilderness encounters. A war horse can fight, using its two front hoof attacks (for 1d6 points
each), with the help of the character riding it.
While guiding the horse, the character cannot
cast a spell, but he can attack or perform some
other action (such as drinking a potion, changing weapons, etc.). When not carrying a rider, a
war horse will defend itself without needing
such guidance. Any class can ride a war horse.
Mules: Mules are cheaper, less glamorous animals than horses, but they are very durable and
reliable mounts and pack animals.
Ponies: Ponies are small riding equines. Their
diminutive stature makes them ideal mounts for
halflings, children, and small characters.
The items and accoutrements listed in the
Land Transportation Gear Table are useful to adventurers who have the above riding animals.
Land Transportation
Equipment Descriptions
The items listed in the Land Transportation
Gear Table are described here and are arranged
alphabetically for your use.
Cart: A cart is pulled either by one or two
draft horses or by two to four mules. The cart's
maximum safe movement rate is 60' (20'); above
that rate, the DM should check once per turn to
see if the cart breaks down or tips over. On 1 on a
1d6, it breaks down, and on a 2 or 3 it tips over.
The cart's carrying capacity is 4,000 cn when
pulled by a single horse, 8,000 cn when pulled
by two. It cannot travel through desert, forest,
mountain, or swamp except by road.
Saddle & Tack: This is a leather and wooden
saddle with metal fastenings. It is assumed to include a blanket, bridle and bit, and stirrups. The
saddle's capacity does not refer to the size of the
rider; it is the amount of encumbrance the saddle can carry in the form of sacks tied to the
saddle-horn, weapon sheathes, etc.
Saddle Bag: This is a long, two-pocketed
leather container that lies behind the saddle.
Wagon: This is a large wooden wagon pulled
by two or four draft horses (or four, six, or eight
mules). The wagon's maximum safe movement
rate is 60' (20'); above that rate, the DM should
check once per turn to see if the wagon breaks
down or tips over. On 1 on a 1d6, it breaks
down, and on a 2 it tips over. The wagon cannot
travel through desert, forest, mountain, or
swamp except by road.
Vehicle Movement Speeds
The animals noted above can pull the carrying
capacities for carts and wagons with no problem
or hindrance against their movement speeds.
The vehicles can be loaded heavier, but movement speeds will suffer.
Simply put, if the animal's normal encumbrance value is equal to or higher than the
weight in the vehicle, it can pull it at its normal
speed. If the encumbrance of the vehicle exceeds
the animal's normal encumbrance value, it can
be pulled at half the animal's normal speed.
For example, one draft horse pulls a cart loaded down with 3,000 cn of cargo; this cart could
travel at the horse's maximum rate of 90' (30'),
though speeds greater than 60' (20') risk upsetting the vehicle and the cargo. The same draft
horse can pull a cart loaded with 5,000 cn of cargo, but this cart moves at half speed or 45' (15').
Water Transportation
When characters must travel along rivers or
across oceans, they'll need to find water transportation. Vessels and pertinent information are
listed in the Sailing Vessels Table.
Crew numbers do not include the captains of
the vessels. All vessels should have a captain except lifeboats, river boats, sailboats, and rafts.
As a rule of thumb, galleys sail only along the
coast; they do not venture across oceans. River
boats and rafts are used for travel on rivers and
will almost surely be destroyed if they venture
too far from coastal shores. Canoes are normally
used on rivers. All other vessels are suitable for
use on the open ocean.
Water Vessel Descriptions
The vessels listed in the Sailing Vessels Table
are described below.
Boat, River: This boat is designed specifically
for river travel. The length is 20'-30', beam
(width) is 10', and draft (depth under water) is
2'-3'. Capacity: 30,000 cn. Crew: 8 rowers, 2
sailors (one of whom acts as captain). It may be

rowed or poled; it may have a wooden roof for
protection from weather (1,000 gp extra).
Boat, Sailing: This is a single-masted boat, designed for lake or coastal use. The length is 15'-
45', beam is 5'-15', and draft is 3'-8'. Capacity:
20,000 cn. Minimum crew: 1 sailor; additional
crew and captain may be hired.
Canoe: This is a light wood frame covered
with hides, canvas, or waterproof bark; it is designed for rivers and swamps. The length is 15',
beam is 3', and draft is 1'. Capacity: 6,000 cn. It
may be carried by one or two people; encumbrance is 1,000 cn for one, 300 cn each for two
people. A special type of canoe, the outrigger,
can sail on the ocean; it costs twice as much as
the normal canoe and has three times the encumbrance.
Galley, Large: This ship is designed for oceans
and large lakes. The length is 120'-150', beam is
15'-20', and draft is 3'. Capacity: 40,000 cn plus
crew. Standard crew: 180 rowers, 20 sailors, 50
marines, 1 captain. It has a single mast with a
square sail. It can have a ram (1/3 additional cost)
and two light catapults (bow and stern).
Galley, Small: Similar to the large galley, this
ship is built for coastal and lake use. The length
is 60'-100', beam is 10'-15', and draft is 2'-3'.
Capacity: 20,000 en plus crew. Standard crew:
60 rowers, 10 sailors, 20 marines, 1 captain. This
ship can have a ram (1/3 extra cost) and two light
catapults (bow and stern).
Galley, War: This large, two-masted galley is
designed for combat; it is often used as a flagship. The length is 120'-150', beam is 20'-30',
and draft is 4'-6'. Capacity: 60,000 cn plus crew.
Standard crew: 300 rowers, 30 sailors, 75 marines, 1 captain. This ship always has a ram and
one deck above the rowers has two light wooden
towers (bow and stern), each 10'-20' square,
height 15'-20'. It can have three light catapults.
Lifeboat, Ship's: This vessel can carry up to
ten people. It is designed for survival and each
has a collapsible mast. The length is 20', beam is
4'-5', and draft is l'-2'. Capacity: 15,000 cn.
Stored onboard the ship is one week's iron rations for ten people. Small ships usually carry
one or two lifeboats; large ships carry three or
four. Lifeboats are not included in the listed cost
of ships. A lifeboat carried onboard another vessel has an encumbrance of 5,000 cn (deducted
from the ship's capacity).
Longship: This ship is designed for river,
ocean, or coastal use. The length is 60'-80',
beam is 10'-15', and draft is 2'-3'. Capacity:
40,000 cn. Standard crew: 75 sailors (acting as
rowers and marines), 1 captain. Sixty rowers are
needed for full speed.
Raft: This is an awkward floating platform or
barge, moved by poles or natural current, and
often equipped with a crude steering oar. Maximum size 30' x 40'. Capacity: 10,000 cn per 100
square feet. The raft may have raised edges and a
tent or wood hut for shelter. It is often dismantled and sold for the value of the wood (1/4 price)
once the cargo reaches a downstream port. It
may be found as a ferry at a river crossing.
Characters can build their own rafts if wood is
available—this takes 1d3 days per 100 square
feet (maximum size 600 square feet). Capacity:
5,000 cn per 100 square feet.
Sailing Ship, Large: This is a three-masted
ship with one or more decks. The length is 100'-
150', beam is 25'-30', and draft is 10'-12'. Capacity: 300,000 cn plus crew. Standard crew: 20
sailors, 1 captain. The bow and stern are raised
"castles" for better field of fire, and it may have
two light catapults.
Sailing Ship, Small: Very similar to the large
sailing ship, the small sailing ship has a single
mast. The length is 60'-80', beam is 20'-30', and
draft is 5'-8'. Capacity: 100,000 cn plus crew.
Standard crew: 10 sailors, 1 captain.
Troop Transport: Identical in size to the large
sailing ship, this ship is designed to carry people.
Capacity: double large sailing ship, calculated
for men and horses. This vessel often has special
modifications. For example, troop transports designed to carry cavalry will have a hatch cut into
the side for loading horses or other animals.
Ship Combat Characteristics
Hull Pts: A ship's ability to remain afloat after
taking water or damage is measured by a number, called hull points. Hull points for a ship are
very similar to hit points for a character; when a
ship reaches zero or fewer hull points, it will sink
in 1d10 rounds.
If a ship is reduced to zero or fewer hull
points, it can no longer move under its own
power or attack with ship-mounted weapons.
The DM can decide whether any onboard catapults are then destroyed (he can choose to roll
1d6, with a 1-4 indicating the weapon is
wrecked); the crew may use personal weapons
normally.
When the PCs buy a ship, the DM decides
how many hull points it has, choosing from the
range of hull points listed in the Sailing Vessels
Table. As a general rule of thumb, a new ship
from a good shipyard will have the maximum
listed hull points. A new ship from a less-reliable
shipyard or a well-maintained older ship will
have somewhat fewer hull points. And a scurvy
river barge that's taking on water will have the
lowest possible hull points indeed.
Armor Class: This number is used to determine chances of success for ram and catapult attacks against a ship.
Ship Modifications
Some ships can be modified for transport or
combat, with additional costs as follows:

*This column shows the vessel's capacity in addition to the listed crew. For example, a river boat can carry 8 people and 40,000 en in additional cargo.
"Cargo" includes any additional passengers.
**If two rates are given, the first rate is for rowing, the second for sailing. The first rate is used on windless days (or rounds), and the second on days or
rounds when there is wind in the sails. If only one rate is given, it is for sailing; on windless days, or days when wind is against the vessel, the vessel
does not move.
t Longship: Sailors acts as both rowers and marines.
tt The hull points and movement rate figures are for each 100 square foot section (10' x 10').
+ Sailing ships have no marines. If this vessel is converted into a troop transport, it can accommodate this number of marines and keep its cargo
capacity, but it costs 1/3 more gp.
add a ram for an additional 1/3 of the ship's listed cost. A war galley already has a ram included
in the cost. Other ships may not add rams.
Troop Transport: A large or small sailing ship
may be converted into a troop transport by pay- ing an additional 1 / 2 of the ship's listed cost. A
troop transport has 1/3 more hull points than a
normal sailing ship, and it carries twice as many
troops as the normal vessel of its type. The one
troop transport listed on the Sailing Vessels Table
is equivalent to a converted large sailing ship.
Catapult: A longship, any type of galley, and
either type of sailed warship may add one light
catapult beyond the numbers of catapults already described for them. The larger sailing
ships may use heavy catapults instead. Ordinary
sailing ships, troop transports, and the smaller
vessels not mentioned above cannot mount a
catapult. A catapult and 20 rounds of shot weigh
20,000 cn. Catapults are discussed later in this
chapter, under "Siege Equipment."
Passage
Characters don't have to buy ships in order to
get from place to place across the water. They can
book passage on commercial vessels. The Passage
Table shows the cost of such transportation based
on the class of passage and the distance traveled.
To use the table, determine how far the character
is traveling; divide that distance by the number
shown, and the result is the cost of passage per
person (in silver pieces).
For example, an adventurer travels 80 miles at
first-class passage. His rate is 80 miles divided by
1 sp = 80 sp for passage. A different adventurer,
traveling the same 80 miles but going by thirdclass, would pay 4 sp (80 miles/20 sp = 4 sp).
The passage classes listed in the Passage Table
are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.
First-Class: These are luxurious accommodations. The character has his own cabin (two or
more people traveling together may book a sin- gle larger cabin). Service is first-rate, and meals
are excellent. Each character has 10,000 cn of
cargo space in the hold available, and he can easily put another 5,000 cn of space in his cabin. He
can purchase an extra 10,000 cn of space in the hold for 1/10 the cost of his passage.
Second-Class: These are decent accommodations. The character is in a small cabin with up to
three other people; some of them may be strangers if characters are traveling singly or do not
arrange to be placed in the same cabin. Service is
minimal, but meals are adequate. Each character
has 5,000 cn of cargo space in the hold available
to him, and he can comfortably fit another 1,000
cn of gear in his cabin. He can purchase an additional 5,000 cn of space in the hold for 1/10 the
cost of his passage.
Third-Class: These are minimal accommodations. The character may have a bunk in a large
common passenger hold; on a smaller boat or
ferry, he may just have a seat open to the sky. If
this is passage on a ship that can hold 20 people
or more, the price of passage includes 1,000 cn
of space in the cargo area. A character can keep
another 500 cn of gear near or under his bunk,
and he can purchase another 1,000 cn of space in
the cargo area for 1/5 the cost of his passage. If
this is passage on a raft, ferry, canoe, or other
small vessel, the character has no cargo privileges
because of space constrictions. He can bring only
what he can comfortably carry on his person, unless he cares to buy another seat at the same rate.
The additional seat would give him about 2,000
cn of room for equipment. Food, if available, is
meager and coarse.
Siege Equipment
Should characters decide to lay siege to a fortification or equip a sailing vessel with heavy
weapons, siege weaponry and miscellaneous
siege information is found in this section.
Many of the siege weapons described here
need to be operated by trained crews. For simplicity's sake, the DM can assume that 1d6 days
spent working with the ballista is sufficient to
train the crew with it. If the campaign uses the
optional General Skills from Chapter 5, the artillery skill counts as training with every existing
type of siege weapon.
Weapon information listed in the Siege Weapons Table is as follows:
Cost (gp) shows only the cost of the weapon
itself; ammunition costs are shown on another
column.
Enc (cn) is the weight of each weapon.
AC shows the weapon's armor class when fired
upon at range; in melee combat, consider siege
weapons to have ACs of 6.
HP shows the weapon's hit points. When a
weapon has taken its listed number of hit points,
it is broken and will no longer work.
Full Crew indicates the optimum size of a crew
to operate this piece of equipment. More crewmen will not improve its performance. If a crew
is less than full, but at least half the listed number, the weapon's rate of fire is half normal. If
the crew is reduced below half but not below 1 / 4
the listed number, the weapon's rate of fire is divided by four. Round down all fractions.
Damage is the amount of damage each weapon can do.
Range should be read as you would for any
missile weapon. However, the "Min" figure is
the closest distance at which the weapon can fire
at a target. A light catapult can't fire at anything
closer than 150 yards, for instance. As usual, targets are + 1 to hit at short range and — 1 to hit at
long range.
Fire Rate describes the maximum rate at
which the weapon can fire; for example, a continuously manned ballista can fire one projectile
every two rounds (20 seconds).
Ammo Cost/Week reflects the amount of ammunition used during a standard week-long
siege. During longer sieges, you'll use the rules
in the "Siege Combat" section of Chapter 8.
This section has more detailed rules pertaining
to the use of siege weapons.
The "Cost," "Standard Size," and "Enc (cn)"
listed in the Miscellaneous Siege Equipment Table on page 74 are self-explanatory; the remaining columns are as follows:
AC shows the equipment's own armor class;
when someone attacks the equipment itself, this
is the armor class he must hit.
AC+ shows the armor class bonus that the
equipment provides to those who are protected
by it. If an armor class 6 character is inside a belfry, his armor class against outside attackers is a
— 2. Once the belfry is destroyed, however, armor class is 6.
HP shows the equipment's hit points; once
the equipment has sustained that number of hit
points, it collapses, becomes useless, and ceases
to protect those within it.
Siege Weapon Descriptions
The weapons listed in the Siege Weapons Table are described here and are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.
Ballista: A ballista is very similar to a normal
crossbow and was actually the crossbow's forerunner. It is much larger (often 5'-10' long) and
mounted on a platform or wheeled carriage. The
ballista described in the Siege Weapons Table is
the largest one available. It is mounted on
wheels (or on a wagon), or it can be placed on a
pivot. The latter is the case when it is installed on
a ship or a defensive fortification.
Ballista ammunition resembles spears, but

* These weapons may have wheels attached and be towed. Towing encumbrance = 1/12 the listed encumbrance; thus a horse pulling a heavy catapult on
wheels is pulling 1,500 cn.
they have larger heads. The ammunition is nearly useless against constructions, but they can inflict some damage to equipment. They are
designed for use against men, animals, and
monsters.
The crew of a ballista must be trained to use
it, but the weapon does not require that an artillerist be present (see "General Skills," in Chapter 5 for the artillery skill).
If a ballista is operated by a trained crew, one
of whom is an artillerist, it fires at the fighter experience level of the artillerist. (If the artillerist is
not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability
of his class; for example, a magic-user of lst-5th
level has the same attack roll as a fighter of 1st3rd level.) If operated by a trained crew with no
artillerist present, take the size of the operating
crew (maximum: 4) and use the size as if it were
the experience level of a fighter; in other words,
the smaller the crew, the worse the attack roll becomes. If operated by an untrained crew, the
ballista fires as though it were a normal man
with a ~8 penalty to the attack roll.
Bore: A bore is a long, heavy loglike device
hung from chains; its metal tip is similar to a
corkscrew. Instead of being carried, it rests within a cradle of chains so it can be freely rotated.
Ropes are wrapped tightly around it and are
pulled alternately from each side by two crews of
four men each.
In use, the bore is rolled up to its target (normally the gate of a fortification). Two men hold
the bore firmly against the target structure while
the other men, in two groups of four, pull the
ropes in sequence to rotate the bore—first one
direction, then the other. The bore actually drills
its way into the target. The bore does not require
a siege specialist to use, but its crew does need to
be trained in its use. A bore is too slow to attack
a mobile target of any sort.
Catapult: A catapult is a huge wooden
"spoon" mounted in a wooden frame. Its lower
end is fixed by twisted ropes, so that the tension
on the ropes keeps the spoon portion nearly upright. When the spoon is pulled down, the ropes
become taut. The spoon is secured in this position, loaded with shot, and released. The spoon
snaps quickly upward until it hits a horizontal
crossbar and stops; the shot continues on its way,
following an arched trajectory. The range varies
by the amount of tension on the ropes.
A trained artillerist knows the proper amounts
of tension for various ranges of fire. Use of the
catapult requires the presence of an artillerist. If
you are using the General Skills rules from
Chapter 5, anyone with the artillery skill can
captain a catapult. Otherwise, the artillerist
must be a hired NPC specialist.
There are two common types of catapults—
light and heavy. Either may be mounted on a
wheeled carriage for towing, but it must be firmly blocked in place when used. Light catapults
may also be mounted on ships.
Catapults cannot be fired at moving targets.
An exception is the ship-mounted catapult,
which is aimed by virtue of the ship steering in
the correct direction; it can only be aimed at very
large monsters and other ships.
If a catapult is operated by a trained crew, one
of whom is an artillerist, it fires at the fighter experience level of the artillerist. (If the artillerist is
not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability
of his class; for example, a magic-user of lst-5th
level has the same attack roll as a fighter of 1st3rd level.) If operated by an untrained crew, or
by a trained crew with no artillerist present, it
fires as though it were a normal man with a — 8
penalty to the attack roll.
Ram, Battering: A battering ram is a large,
heavy log or similar device mounted on wheels.
The log is usually capped with metal. This end is
repeatedly slammed against a target (such as a
door or gate), using brute force to cause damage.
The standard battering ram is 10' long and
needs a 10-man crew to operate. For a longer
ram, add one crewman per extra foot of length.
A ram can be transported by fewer men than it
takes to operate it.
The ram is commonly used by fastening it securely to stout chains attached to a wheeled gallery shed ceiling or belfry (see "Miscellaneous
Siege Equipment," below). The ram is then easily rolled up to and swung against the target.
When a ram is used in this manner, only one
man is needed for each 2' of the ram's length; a
five-man crew is sufficient for a 10' battering
ram. The crew of a battering ram does not have
to be trained in its use.
Trebuchet: Somewhat similar to the catapult,
a trebuchet is a huge wooden bar with a sling at
one end, mounted on a wooden frame in seesaw
fashion. Instead of using ropes and tension to
propel it, the bar is mounted on a pivot so that
part of the bar projects toward the target. A large
basket or net is hung from this end and is filled
with weights. Ropes are used to pull the long
sling arm down and to hold it for loading.
When released, the weights pull the short arm
downward and the long arm pivots quickly upward. The sling slows naturally as the weights
reach the bottom of the arc and flies open, causing the shot to fly off in a high, arched trajectory.
The range of fire is determined by the amount of
weight in the basket or net and by the exact position of the basket on the short arm of the bar.
If a trebuchet is operated by a trained crew,
one of whom is an artillerist, it fires at the fighter
experience level of the artillerist. (If the artillerist
is not a fighter, use the equivalent fighting ability of his class; for example, a magic-user of 1st5th level has the same attack roll as a fighter of
1st-3rd level.) If operated by an untrained crew,
or by a trained crew with no artillerist present, it
fires as though it were a normal man with a — 8
penalty to the attack roll.
Alternative Types of Ammunition
Previously, weapon tables have shown damage
and cost factors for normal ammunition. Normal
ammunition is ammunition of a consistent quality, weight, and size.
In the field, characters sometimes have to rely
on available stones and projectiles to launch
from their weapons. This greatly reduces the cost
of operating a weapon continuously, but is a
drain on manpower due to having to find ammunition. The DM will decide in any such instance whether this foraging for ammunition
slows down the rate of fire or diminishes the
weapon's effectiveness. Foraged rocks may not
be as accurate as standard ammunition, and the
DM can assign attack roll penalties to those who
use them. Only catapults and trebuchets may
utilize found stones.
Another type of ammunition is pitch shot.
Pitch shot consists of a large ball of pitch (sometimes mixed with gravel) loaded into the weapon
and lit just before it's fired. Pitch shot does not
do normal damage. Where it hits, it does 1d6
fire damage in a 10' X 10' area; it ignites any
flammable targets (such as oil) that it hits.
Wooden structures can be damaged by pitch
attacks. Damage starts out slowly—instead of
taking 1d6 points of damage, wooden structures
take only 1 point. But wooden structures attacked by fire can be set afire, causing further
damage. A building's chance to catch fire is 5%
per point of damage caused by each fire attack.
This is cumulative during any one-day period—
in other words, a building hit by one fire attack
has a 5% chance to catch fire, a 10% chance on
the next attack, and so on. Anything set afire
will take 1 point of damage the first round, 3
more points by the end of the first turn, 6 points
the second turn, and 12 points for each turn
thereafter until destroyed.
Catapults and trebuchets can use pitch shots;
their firing bowls must be specially reinforced
(costing 50 gp) to fire pitch shot. Pitch shot costs
five times as much as normal shot.
Miscellaneous Siege
Equipment Descriptions
The equipment listed in the Miscellaneous
Siege Equipment Table is described here and is
arranged alphabetically for your convenience.
Belfry: A belfry (or siege tower) is a protected
stairway. The standard belfry is a 30' tall building on wheels, made of a stout wood frame with
thin walls. The walls are covered with uncured or
wet animal hides and blankets to minimize fire
damage. The interior of the building contains a
well-built stairway. One or two doors lead into
the building at the base. A drawbridge near the
top of the belfry is controlled from inside. A final set of steps leads to the roof of the belfry,
with access protected by a trap door barred on
the inside.
In use, the belfry is pushed or pulled up to a
wall; troops then enter the doors and climb the
stairway. When ready, they lower the drawbridge
so that it gives access to the top of the adjacent
wall, and then charge across to melee. Some
troops may take a position atop the belfry, adding missile fire to the melee atop the wall.
If a belfry is subjected to fire attack, it takes
full initial fire damage, but it has only a 5%
chance to ignite for each 2 points of fire damage
it sustains. (See the description above for pitch
shot and see Chapter 8 for more details on fires
and fire fighting.)
Gallery Shed: This protective device is a wooden building with a light frame construction. It
has side walls but no end walls. The roof is normally covered with animal hides or wet blankets
to minimize fire damage. The standard gallery
shed is 20' long, 10' wide, and 10' tall. It can be
carried by 20 men, and it gives a -12 bonus to
the armor class of those within it. A gallery shed
is most often used along with a ram or bore,
which is suspended by chains from the ceiling of
the shed before advancing on the enemy.
Hoist: A hoist is a machine used to lift small
numbers of troops over or to the top of a wall or
other obstruction. A hoist consists of a light
frame, similar to a belfry's, with a long beam
projecting from the top and a pulley on the
beam. A large basket, capable of carrying up to
four men, is raised by ropes through the pulley
and connected to a winch. The rate of ascent varies by the number of crewmen operating the
hoist and by the number of troops in the basket.
A hoist is normally used to raise well-armed or
higher level troops (those who can withstand
some missile fire before engaging in melee) to
the top of a wall.
Ladder: The siege ladder is a large, sturdy version of the common ladder. It is most effective
when used by surprise or against defenders already occupied by attackers from a belfry or
hoist. Used alone, ladders are easily toppled or
broken by defenders.
To topple a ladder, take the number of defenders trying to topple the ladder (numbers
greater than four count as four) and multiply
that number by four. The attacker (on the ladder) must roll above that result on 1d20 as a saving throw each round or the ladder is toppled.
The attacker may attempt this save once per
round.
Mantlet: A mantlet is a wooden wall, built
with wheels for easy movement. The standard
mantlet is 8' long and 4' high and can shield up
to five men. Those protected by the mantlet gain
a - 4 bonus to armor class. Mantlets are often
used by troops who are pushing a belfry up to a
wall and by those operating or waiting for use of
a hoist.
Timber Fort: A timber fort is a heavy wooden
wall built in sections. It is movable only with difficulty. Each section of the wall is 8' long and 4'-
5' high. Those protected by a timber fort gain a
- 8 bonus to armor class.
Final Notes on Siege Weapons

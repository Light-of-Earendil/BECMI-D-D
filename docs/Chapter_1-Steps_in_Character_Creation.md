Sooner or later you will want to make up your
own new character. Before you start, get a
pencil and the multisided dice used with the
D&D® game. You will also need a blank character sheet (or a piece of notebook paper) to keep
track of the details. A sample character sheet is
found in Appendix 3.
If you are using a blank piece of paper, copy
the form of the character sheet onto it—in other
words, allow a space for your name and the character's name at the top left, a place for character
class, level, armor class, and hit points below
that, and so forth. The Dungeon Master should
be present and should watch the creation of any
player character, including all dice rolls.
Your first try at creating a new character will
probably take an hour or so. Even when you are
used to the procedure, it will still take 10-30
minutes. If the Dungeon Master is just beginning a new campaign, he should call everyone
together for a session where all players create
their characters and where he describes the campaign world in which the others will be playing.
Once the campaign is underway, a player
shouldn't try to create a character at the beginning of a play-session (unless the DM specifically
asks him to)—it delays the start of the game. All
the rolling, adjusting, buying, and so forth
should be done beforehand.
The following is a list of the steps to take when
making a new character; each step is then explained in detail.
Steps to creating a character:
1. Roll for ability scores 2. Choose a character class
3. Adjust ability scores 4. Roll for hit points
5. Roll for money
6. Buy equipment
7. Determine other numbers and rolls
8. Note adjustments for ability scores
9. Choose character alignment
10. Select name, personality, and back- ground
11. Determine character height and weight
12. Earn experience
Roll for Ability Scores
Roll 3d6 for each ability:
Strength
Intelligence
Wisdom
Dexterity
Constitution
Charisma
Many of the attributes that make up a
character—for instance, his physical might and
his level of intelligence—are represented by
numbers in the game. Six of these are the character's abilities: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
Strength (Str) is the character's physical
might. It affects the amount of damage the character does with hand-to-hand weapons (such as
swords and clubs) and thrown weapons (such as
thrown spears and knives), affects his chance to
hit with hand-to-hand weapons, and determines
his ability to do such things as break down
locked doors.
Intelligence (Int) is the character's mental
might. It affects the number of languages the
character can learn.
Wisdom (Wis) is the character's strength of
understanding of the world, the way things
work, the forces of nature, and so forth. It affects
the character's natural ability to resist magical
spells.
Dexterity (Dex) is the character's nimbleness
and grace. It affects the character's ability to
wield missile and thrown weapons (such as bows
and throwing knives) and can make it harder for
enemies to hit the character.
Constitution (Con) is the character's physical
health and vigor. It affects the character's hit
points score (i.e., his ability to survive being injured).
Charisma (Cha) is the character's force of personality and presence. It affects the way other
characters, especially nonplayer characters controlled by the DM, react to the character.
You roll dice to find each ability score. This is
done by rolling the six-sided die three times and
adding the results. Or, if you have three sixsided dice, roll the dice together. (This is normally referred to in the text as "rolling 3d6.")
For example, if you roll ones each time, then
the total score is 3, the least score possible. If you
roll all sixes, then the total is 18, the highest
score you can have.
You should end up with six numbers, each between 3 and 18. These are your character's ability
scores. Write the scores down as you roll them,
next to the names of the abilities.
High ability scores can help the character in
certain things. For example, high Strength allows a character to deal out more damage in
combat; a high Constitution helps a character
survive injury; a high Charisma helps a character
attract friends. Low scores have exactly the opposite effect. We'll discuss these effects in the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores Table.
You can adjust the ability scores in Step 3
("Adjust Ability Scores"), but first you must decide what class your character will be.
Prime Requisites
Each character class requires prowess in one of
the abilities—in other words, each class has an
ability that is of utmost importance to that class.
(For example, a fighter's most important ability
is Strength and a cleric's is Wisdom.) These are
known as prime requisites.
Each character class has its own prime requisite. This means each class is talented at certain
things, such as fighting (fighters because of their
Strength), healing (clerics because of their Wisdom), sneaking about (thieves because of their
Dexterity), and so on. The higher a character's
prime requisite score, the more skill he will have
in his class (his "job"). Prime requisites for each
class are listed with the character class.
Choose a Character Class
A character class is a character's main profession in the campaign. Think of each character
class as a sort of stereotype. For instance, all warriors in books and movies have some features in
common and those specific features, translated
into the D&D® game terms, are what make up
the fighter character class.
The player character (PC) classes available for
you to choose include four human classes (cleric,
fighter, magic-user, thief), three demihuman
classes (dwarf, elf, halfling), and two special
character classes (druid, mystic).
You've probably noticed that the names of the
demihuman character classes sound more like
race or species names than professions. That's
because demihumans are more limited in their
options than humans are, so the entire race can
be represented by a single character class.
Types of Character Classes
Most characters will be humans. In most D&D
game campaigns, humans are the most widespread of all intelligent beings. Any new character can belong to one of the human classes
(cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief), regardless of
his ability scores.

Demihuman characters (dwarf, elf, and halfling) should be a little less common: these races
are supposed to be somewhat reclusive and mysterious. They are known as "demihumans" because they are so similar to humans. Each
demihuman character class has specific ability requirements. If a newly created character doesn't
have high enough scores in some specific abilities, he can't belong to the demihuman classes.
The special character classes (druid and mystic) technically belong in the set of human character classes, but they have such stringent
requirements and unusual guidelines that
they're set aside for you to look at separately.
The DM might not want to use them in his campaign; it's easier for him to make and enforce
this decision if they're set aside.
Descriptions of Character
Classes
A Cleric is a human character who has dedicated his life to a great and worthy cause. Often,
this cause is the cleric's alignment. A Lawful cleric, for example, would be dedicated to spreading
law and order throughout the campaign world.
The cleric wields magic, and he can use almost as
many weapons and armor types as a fighter. The
cleric's prime requisite is his Wisdom.
A Fighter is a character whose main skill is his
prowess at arms. A fighter can be a heavily armored knight or a lightly armored swashbuckler,
but it's his extraordinary skill in combat that
makes him special. In the game, a fighter's
prime requisite is his Strength.
A Magic-User is a character who wields magic.
He has little or nothing in the way of fighting
ability, and in the early part of his career he has
little in the way of magical ability either. But as
he gains in experience, he becomes a powerful
character and can wield powerful magical spells.
The magic-user's prime requisite is his Intelligence.
A Thief is a character who has spying abilities.
Whether he actually makes his living stealing
from other people, he has many skills appropriate to that livelihood. He can move stealthily,
climb sheer surfaces, pick locks, and so forth. He
has combat abilities better than a magic-user's,
but he's not a strong combatant. The thiefs
prime requisite is his Dexterity.
A Dwarf is a sturdy, squat demihuman. He resembles the fighter in many details, but has
many special abilities—and special restrictions—
that set him apart from human fighters. The
dwarfs prime requisite is his Strength. Also, a
dwarf character must have a Constitution score
of 9 or more. If the character you're creating has
a Constitution of 8 or less, he cannot be a dwarf.
An Elf is a lean, nimble demihuman. He is a
very capable combination of the fighter and
magic-user classes. He's not quite as tough as a
human fighter, nor will he ever achieve the great
magical ability of a human magic-user, but he
does have most of the abilities of both classes.
He has other special abilities and restrictions that
set him apart from the human classes. The elf
has two prime requisites: Strength and Intelligence, and the Intelligence score must be 9 or
more. If the character you're creating has an Intelligence of 8 or less, he cannot be an elf.
A Halfling is a small demihuman. He has
many abilities similar to a fighter, but he is also
noted for his ability in woodsmanship. He's not
as tough as a fighter, and he has special abilities
and restrictions that set him apart from the
fighter class. The halfling has two prime requisites: Strength and Dexterity, and the Dexterity
score must be 9 or more. Also, a halfling character must have a score of 9 or better for his Constitution.
A Druid is a special type of spellcaster who devotes himself to the needs and preservation of
Nature. However, you can't start a character off
as a druid. A druid character must start off as a
cleric—in fact, as a cleric of the Neutral alignment (alignments are discussed in Step 9,
"Choose Character Alignment")—and earn a
lot of experience (up to 9th experience level) as a
cleric. Only at that point can he become a druid.
A Mystic is a type of warrior-monk. He lives a
monastic life, devotes himself to philosophy and
the mastery of his physical body, and trains himself to become a master of unarmed fighting.
Mystics are not appropriate to all campaigns, so
the DM has the option of refusing to allow mystics in his world. The mystic's prime requisites
are Strength and Dexterity. Also, a mystic character must have scores of 13 or better in both his
Wisdom and Dexterity abilities.
All these character classes will be described in
greater detail in Chapter 2. If you don't yet
know enough about these classes to decide what
your new character should be, you can skip
ahead to Chapter 2, then return here and make
your choice. When you've decided what character class your character will be, continue with the
next step.
Adjust Ability Scores
You can trade two points from an ability
score you don't want to raise your prime requisite by one point. You can perform this
trade as many times as you want, so long as
you do not lower any ability below a score of
9. You cannot lower your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma. You can only raise your
character's prime requisite score.
Once you've rolled your character's abilities
and decided on his character class, it is possible
to raise his prime requisite by lowering other
ability scores. This is sort of like training hard to
improve one skill while letting others become
neglected. (For example, a magic-user might
spend all his time studying hard, neglecting his
exercise; he'd end up with a higher Intelligence
and a lower Strength.)
These are the rules for exchanging ability
points:
1. The prime requisite goes up 1 point for each
2 points that another ability score goes down.
If a character has two prime requisites, both
can be raised.
2. Constitution and Charisma points cannot be
exchanged with others.
3. Dexterity cannot be lowered (but it may be
raised for a thief or halfling character).
4. No score can be lowered below 9. If it is already 10 or less, it cannot be lowered.
Example: An elf has Intelligence and Strength
scores of 12 and a Wisdom of 13. His player
wants him to be both stronger and smarter. He
drops the Wisdom score by 2, to 11, so 1 point
can be added to Strength. Then he drops the
Wisdom again, to 9, and adds 1 to Intelligence.
This results are Intelligence and Strength scores
of 13 and an adjusted Wisdom of 9-
A cleric with Strength and Wisdom of 15
drops the Strength by 6 (to 9) and raises the Wisdom by 3 (to 18).
If you want to exchange any ability score
points, you must do that now before you go any
further in making the character. No such adjustments can be made later. Remember that you do
not have to adjust any ability scores. This is an
option, not a requirement.
Roll for Hit Points
Your character's hit point score represents his
ability to survive injury. The higher his hit point
score, the more damage he can sustain before
dying. Characters who survive long enough to
gain a good deal of experience typically gain
more and more hit points; therefore, an experienced character lasts longer in a fight or other
dangerous situations than does an inexperienced
character.
A character's profession (his character class) dramatically affects the number of hit points he receives. Fighters and dwarves receive a lot of hit
points. Magic-users and thieves receive only a few.
The other classes receive a medium amount.
Find your character's class on the Character
Class and Hit Dice Table, and then roll the type
of die indicated in order to find your starting hit
points. Note that your character's Constitution
score can affect the number of hit points he will
have. Look for the Bonuses and Penalties for
Ability Scores Table and apply the appropriate
number to the number of hit points rolled for
your character.

Roll for Money
Roll 3d6 and multiply by 10 to find your
character's starting gold pieces.
Your character starts out with no possessions
except for normal clothes and a little money,
saved up over many years. You will need to go
shopping for equipment, but first you must find
out how much money you have.
Roll 3d6 (three six-sided dice), and multiply
the total by 10. (For example, if you roll 12, the
total is 120.) This is the number of gold pieces
(gp) that you start with. Write that on your character sheet. If you're using a hand-written sheet,
write down the word "Money" on the back and
put beside it the number you've just rolled.
Buy Equipment
Now that you have your money, you can spend
it on the equipment you need to go adventuring. There is a complete list of equipment in
Chapter 4 later in this book. Be sure to ask your
Dungeon Master if everything on that list is
available in his campaign. If his campaign deviates a lot from the "standard" D&D® game
campaign, he could have a very different list of
equipment, which he should provide for you.
There are restrictions on what items your character is allowed to have, especially on armor and
weapons. Before you go shopping, be sure you
have read the full description of your character
class, later in this chapter.
For example, a magic-user cannot wear any armor at all and can only use a few types of weapons. It would be a waste of money for a character
of this class to buy a sword or shield; instead, his
money can be saved or spent on oil, torches, and
other items. Thieves, however, must buy
thieves' tools to use their Open Locks ability.
On a piece of piece paper, write down all the
equipment you want to buy and add up the cost.
If it costs more gold pieces than you have, you
must erase something from the list. When you
can pay for your list of equipment, subtract the
cost from your money, and write the equipment
down on your character sheet.
Be careful when shopping! You may forget to
buy rope, for example, and suddenly find a need
for it during an adventure—and if you didn't
buy it, you don't have it. Ask the other players
and your DM for advice on what to buy—and
what not to buy. Remember that money can be
saved for buying expensive equipment later.
Don't Forget Spells
If your character is a spellcaster, he will also
need to equip himself with the spells he knows.
Magic-users know one spell at their first level of
experience, while clerics learn their first spell at
second level. Ask your DM for the spells which
your character knows.
Magic-users also need to have spell books to
record the spells they know. A magic-user's first
spell book is free, a gift of the wizard who taught
him. Clerics do not need spell books.
Determine Other
Numbers and Rolls
Armor class, attack rolls, and saving throws are
numbers—numbers which you'll calculate from
the character's other attributes or find on provided tables—which are important to the way the
character performs in combat.
Armor Class
Armor class, sometimes abbreviated as AC, is
a number indicating how tough it is to hit your
character. With the armor class, unlike most
numbers in the D&D game, a low number is
good for a character, and a high number is bad.
Your armor class is a combination of the type
of armor you are wearing, plus any adjustments
due to Dexterity. First, find your armor type on
the Armor Type and Armor Class Table.
Armor Type and Armor Class Table_____
Armor Type Armor Class
No armor 9
Leather armor 7
Scale armor 6
Chain mail 5
Banded armor 4
Plate mail 3
Suit armor 0
Shield Subtract 1*
* If using a shield, subtract 1 from the AC
number. Example: chain mail alone is AC 5,
but with a shield it is AC 4.
Once you know your armor class as provided
by your armor type, you can determine adjustments to your armor class from your Dexterity.
Find your Dexterity score on the Bonuses and
Penalties For Ability Scores table. For every + 1
on the table, subtract 1 from your armor class.
For every — 1, add 1 to your armor class.
Example: If you are wearing chain mail and a
shield (AC 4), but have a Dexterity score of 15
( + 1 bonus), your armor class number improves
and goes down, to 3. If you are wearing plate
mail and shield (AC 2) but have a Dexterity
score of 5 ( ~ 2 penalty), your armor class worsens
and goes up to 4.
Remember: The lower the AC number, the
harder you are to hit. A penalty to armor class
actually raises the number, making you easier to
hit. If your AC is even better than zero, then
negative numbers, or "minus" numbers, are
used. For example, a character with a Dexterity
Score of 18 (a +3 bonus, which translates to - 3
to the AC) and wearing plate mail and shield
(AC 2) would have an AC of "minus one" (- 1).
Attack Rolls
An attack roll is a number representing how
easy or difficult it is for your character to hit other targets.
In combat, when your character is trying to hit
another character, you roll 1d20; this is known as
his attack roll. (In some game supplements, it's
also called the "hit roll," "to-hit roll," or "roll to
hit.") Once you know the number you've rolled
on the die, you add any bonuses your character
gets from high ability scores, magical weapons,
or other factors. You'll compare that final result
to the number required to hit the armor class of
your character's opponent. If you reach or exceed
that number, your character has successfully hit
his opponent.
But how do you find out what number you
need to hit a certain armor class? That's simple
enough: We provide it to you on handy tables.
Take a look at the Attack Rolls Table on page
106. Go ahead and flip forward to that table and
return here when you've looked at it.
To use the table, cross-reference your character's experience level and character class with his
opponent's armor class. On the table, "MU"
stands for magic-user, "C,T,D" stands for "clerics, thieves, and druids," "F" stands for "fighters" (and also includes mystics and low-level
demihumans), and "DH" stands for "demihumans" (and is used for high-experience demihumans). The numbers "19" through "-20"
stand for the opposition's armor class.
A 1st level fighter attacks an enemy with an
armor class (AC) of 2. On the Attack Rolls Table
in Chapter 8, go to the "F" (for fighter) column,
go down to where it says "1-3" (which means
"Experience Levels 1 through 3"), and then go
right to the column corresponding to AC 2. You
need to roll a 17 to hit that armor class.
Attack Rolls Tables vs. THACO
Now, record your character's attack rolls on
the character sheet. There are two ways to do
this. One is for beginning players and for players
who sometimes have a hard time juggling numbers; the other is for experienced players who
don't have trouble juggling numbers.
AC: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5
Attack Roll: 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 20 20 20 20
Attack Rolls: With the first way, you write down
your character's rolls to hit several armor classes.
Instead of recording all the listed armor classes
(19 to -20), we usually record only ACs 9 to
~5; these are the armor classes most commonly
encountered in a game.
On your character sheet, you'd make a small, .
simple table listing the attack rolls for your character's level and character class. An example is
given on this page of the attack rolls for a first
level fighter; for all characters, refer to the main
table in Chapter 8, then write down the pertinent information on your character sheet. This
way, when your first level fighter is attacking an
AC of -2, you'd be able to look down on his
character sheet and see immediately that he
needs to achieve a roll of 20 to hit his target.
THACO: The abbreviation THACO stands for
"To Hit Armor Class 0." There's nothing mysterious about it: It's just the number your character needs to hit armor class 0. On the table
immediately above, for example, you see that a
1st level fighter needs to achieve a roll of 19 to
hit an armor class of 0; therefore, his THACO is
19.
Some experienced players will not want to
have an entire table cluttering up their character
sheets; they'll just record their characters'
THACO number. Additionally, many abbreviated descriptions of monsters used in D&D®
game adventures will use the THACO number.
To use THACO, you have to do some adding
and subtracting during combat. You subtract
your modified attack roll (the number rolled on
a 20-sided die plus any bonuses) from your
THACO, and the result is the armor class your
character hits.
For example, Ruggin is a 3rd level dwarf, and
he's fighting a hobgoblin clad in chain mail (AC
5). Ruggin's THACO is 19, and he rolls a 16;
Ruggin successfully hits his opponent's armor
class (19 -16 = 3) since he hit an AC 3 (two
better than AC 5).
Likewise, instead of figuring out which AC
your attack hits, you can use THACO to determine what number is needed to hit a specific armor class. Subtract the defender's armor class
from the attacker's THACO. If the armor class is
a negative value, add the armor class number to
the attacker's THACO. The result is the number
the attacker needs to hit his opponent.
For instance, Ruggin the 3rd level dwarf needs
a 19 or better on a 20-sided die to hit a monster
with AC 0. Ruggin is facing a troll (AC 4) and he
needs a roll of 15 or greater to hit the monster
(19-4 = 15).
If you're a beginning player, you should stick
to the larger table; when you're comfortable
with it, you can practice using the THACO number. When you're equally comfortable with
THACO, you can stop recording the whole table
on your character sheet, and merely record
THACO.
Saving Throws
Find your character's class and experience
level on the Saving Throws Table in Chapter
8. Move across to the column representing
the type of attack your character is sustaining. The number shown in that column is
your saving throw. Roll that number or better on 1d20 to avoid or diminish the effects of
the attack.
A saving throw represents your character's attempt to avoid the effects of some sort of unusual attack—poison, magical spells, the flaming
breath of a dragon, and so forth. A successful
saving throw means that the character either sustains a reduced amount of damage or suffers no
harmful effect at all, depending on the type of
attack. An unsuccessful saving throw means that
the character sustains the full damage or effect of
the attack. The saving throw is rolled on 1d20
when specified by the DM.
A character doesn't have just one saving throw
number; he has a different one for each of five
different categories of unusual attacks. Those
categories include "Poison or Death Ray," "Magic Wand," "Turning to Stone or Paralysis,"
"Dragon Breath," and "Spells or Magic Staff."
Saving throws are based on your character's
class and experience level. You can find your
character's saving throws on the Saving Throws
Table on page 109 of Chapter 8. Go ahead and
flip to that table, look it over, and return here.
To find the saving throws for your character,
simply look up his class and experience level. For
example, if your character is a 1st level elf, his
saving throws would be:
Death Ray or Poison: 12; Magic Wand: 13; Paralysis or Turn to Stone: 13; Dragon Breath: 15;
Spells or Staff: 15
Write the saving throws appropriate for your
character on his character sheet.
High Wisdom and Saving Throws
If a character has a Wisdom score of 13 or
more, he receives a bonus to one of his saving
throws; if his Wisdom is 8 or less, he receives a
penalty.
Take a look at the Bonuses and Penalties for
Ability Scores Table below. If your Wisdom score
is high or low enough for a bonus or penalty, record that on your character sheet beside your
Wisdom score. This bonus or penalty affects
your character's saving throws vs. spells. When
rolling your saving throw vs. spells, you can add
the character's Wisdom bonus to his saving
throw (or must subtract the penalty, if he has a
penalty instead).
Note Adjustments for
Ability Scores
You've already seen, on several occasions, that
high abilities give your character special bonuses, while low ones give the character special
penalties. Below are the character's abilities and
notes on what sorts of adjustments high and low
abilities will bring him.
When you have high scores in abilities, note
the specific adjustments which result from them;
if you're not using a character sheet which already has blanks for these adjustments, place
them beside the abilities (Strength, etc.) which
grant them to the character. The Bonuses and
Penalties for Ability Scores Table shows ability
adjustments.
Bonuses and Penalties for Ability Scores
Ability Score Adjustment
2-3 -3 Penalty
4-5 -2 Penalty
6-8 -1 Penalty
9-12 No adjustment
13-15 +1 Bonus
16-17 +2 Bonus 18 +3 Bonus
Now, let's go through each of the abilities and
see what high scores will do for each ability.
Strength
High Strength affects how well a character hits
with melee weapons—that is, hand-held weapons. It affects how much damage the character
does with melee weapons, and with thrown
weapons like hurled knives and spears. And it affects how often a character can budge stuck doorways.
The character's adjustment for a high
Strength score is applied to any roll he makes to
hit someone in melee combat.
For instance, if a character has a Strength of 17
(therefore, a +2 adjustment), and rolls a 9 on
his Id20 to hit someone, he gets to add his
Strength adjustment to that roll. He has actually
achieved a roll of 11 (9 + 2 = 11). If the character has a Strength of 8 (therefore, a - 1 penalty)
and rolls a 9, he has to subtract his penalty; he
has actually achieved a roll of 8 (9 - 1 = 8).
The character's adjustment for Strength is also
applied to damage he does with melee and
thrown weapons.
For example, let us say a character with
Strength 18 (adjustment +3) hits someone with
a sword and does 8 points of damage. He adds
his Strength bonus to the damage, and so has actually done 11 points of damage. Likewise, a
character with a Strength of 5 (adjustment -2)
who rolls 8 points of damage has actually only
done 6 points of damage (8 — 2 = 6).
Finally, the character gets his bonus or penalty
to his Open Doors roll. The Open Doors roll is
the character's ability to force open stuck doors.
(The DM can optionally use it to decide whether
the character is strong enough to perform similar
feats of strength, such as moving obstructions.)
The Open Doors roll is rolled on a Id6, with a
roll of 5 or 6 meaning success; the character with
high Strength applies his adjustment to the
number he rolls on the die. However, a natural,
unmodified "6" on an Open doors roll will always open a door, despite any penalties to the
contrary.
Abilities and Adjustments Table
Ability Adjustments To:
Strength Attack Rolls (Melee Weapons and Unarmed Combat), Damage Rolls (Melee and Thrown Weapons), Opening Doors
Intelligence Languages, General Skills (Optional)
Wisdom Saving Throws vs. Spells
Dexterity Attack Rolls (Thrown and Missile Weapons), Armor Class
Constitution Hit Points per Experience Level
Charisma Reactions from NPCs
For example, a character with Strength 13 (ad- justment + 1) tries to budge a stuck door. On his
Id6, he rolls a 4. This isn't enough; it's not a 5 or
6. But he adds his +1 adjustment, his 4 becomes a 5, and suddenly it's enough: He can
budge the stuck door. Similarly, a character with
Strength 3 (adjustment ~3) tries a similarly
stuck door. On his Id6, he rolls a 5, normally a
success. But he must apply his ~3 adjustment
and his 5 suddenly becomes a 2, a failure.
Intelligence
High Intelligence affects the number of languages a character knows. If the DM is using the
optional general skills rules, high Intelligence al- so affects the number of general skills the character knows.
A human character of "average" Intelligence
(a score of 9-12) knows two languages: the Common tongue and an alignment tongue. The character can read and write those languages.
(The Common tongue is the "standard" tongue
for the campaign. A campaign set in modern
America would have English as its Common
tongue, for example.) Demihuman characters usually know additional languages, as described
for each demihuman character class.
If the character receives an adjustment from
an Intelligence over 12 (a bonus, in other
words), this is the number of additional lan- guages the character can read and write. Your
Dungeon Master will tell you what languages are
available. You must choose your added languages before you play the character in a game.
If the Intelligence adjustment is a penalty, then the character has trouble writing and perhaps speaking.
In either case, look at the Intelligence and
Languages Table.
Intelligence and Languages Table
Intelligence Use of
Score Languages
3 Has trouble speaking, cannot
read or write
4-5 Cannot read or write Common
6-8 Can write simple Common
words
9-12 Reads and writes native
languages (usually two)
13-15 Reads and writes native
languages, +1 additional
language 16-17 Reads and writes native
languages, +2 additional
languages
18 Reads and writes native
languages, + 3 additional
languages
If your campaign makes use of a lot of
languages—especially common in a campaign
where the player characters travel through a lot
of foreign lands, or where there are a lot of talking monster species—a character's ability with
languages can be very important.
Wisdom
The effects of a high Wisdom are discussed
above, under "High Wisdom and Saving
Throws." Adjustments for high Wisdom scores
affect the character's saving throws vs. spells.
Dexterity
The effects of a high Dexterity are discussed
above, under "Armor Class." Adjustments for
high Dexterity scores affect the character's AC. They also affect the character's ability to hit
with missile weapons—any thrown weapons or
weapons launched through the air. The character's adjustment for a high or low Dexterity is applied to his roll to hit when he is using missile weapons.
For example, a character with a 17 Dexterity
(adjustment + 2), using a bow, is trying to shoot
a distant enemy. He needs a 13 to hit his enemy.
On his 1d20 attack roll, he rolls a 12. He has failed. But now he adds his bonus for high Dexterity ( + 2) and his 12 becomes a 14: He has actually hit his opponent.
Constitution
Your Constitution score can affect the number
of hit points you have. Look earlier in this chapter for the Bonuses and Penalties for Ability
Scores table, and apply the bonus or penalty to
the number of hit points you rolled. But whatever the adjustments, your hit points cannot be
lowered to 0 (zero); you will have at least 1 hit
point for each roll. Each time a character gains a level of experience (a measure of how experienced he is), roll
for more hitpoints. And each time you roll, you
adjust the roll according to your Constitution
score. Eventually, your character will stop gaining
dice of hit points every time he earns a level of
experience, and will no longer gain bonuses for a
very high or very low Constitution score. Instead, he'll start getting a pre-set number of hit
points every level, and his Constitution bonus
will not apply to that number. But that's off in
the future; don't worry about it right now.
Charisma
A character's Charisma score will affect how
others, whether characters or monsters, react to
him—when the character is talking to them (but
not unless he is talking).
If he tries to hire retainers (bodyguards, assistants, and so forth), his Charisma will determine
the number he can hire, and how loyal they will
be. Your Dungeon Master will tell you if any retainers are available, and will play the roles of
the retainers your character finds and (possibly)
hires.
Charisma Adjustment Table
Charisma Reaction Max. No. Retainer
Score Adj. Retainers Morale
3 -3 1 4
4-5 -2 2 5
6-8 -1 3 6
9-12 No adj. 4 7
13-15 +1 5 8
16-17 +2 6 9
18 +3 7 10
Whenever your character is talking to any
creature (monster or character) controlled by the DM, tell the DM what your reaction adjustment
is. If your Dungeon Master allows the use of retainers and you attempt to employ some, you
will need to tell him your character's maximum
number of retainers, as well as the Retainer Mo- rale score (which is a measure of loyalty and courage). Reaction adjustments due to high
Charisma never adjust any rolls you make; they
only affect rolls made by the Dungeon Master, so
he needs to know this information.
Choose Character
Alignment
An alignment is a code of behavior or way of
life which guides the actions and thoughts of
characters and monsters. There are three alignments in the D&D® game: Law, Chaos, and
Neutrality. Players may choose the alignments they feel
will best fit their characters. A player does not
have to tell other players what alignment he or
she has picked, but must tell the Dungeon Master. Most Lawful characters will reveal their alignments if asked. When picking alignments, the characters
should know that Chaotics cannot be trusted,
even by other Chaotics. A Chaotic character does
not work well with other PCs.
Alignments give characters guidelines,to live by. They are not absolute rules: characters will
try to follow their alignment guidelines, but may
not always be successful. To better understand
the philosophies behind them, let's define the
three alignments.
Law (or Lawful)
Law is the belief that everything should follow
an order, and that obeying rules is the natural
way of life. Lawful creatures will try to tell the truth, obey laws that are fair, keep promises, and
care for all living things.
If a choice must be made between the benefit
of a group or an individual, a Lawful character
will usually choose the group. Sometimes indi- vidual freedoms must be given up for the good
Abilities and Adjustments Table
Ability Adjustments To:
Strength Attack Rolls (Melee Weapons and Unarmed Combat), Damage Rolls (Melee and Thrown Weapons), Opening Doors
Intelligence Languages, General Skills (Optional)
Wisdom Saving Throws vs. Spells
Dexterity Attack Rolls (Thrown and Missile Weapons), Armor Class
Constitution Hit Points per Experience Level
Charisma Reactions from NPCs
For example, a character with Strength 13 (ad- justment + 1) tries to budge a stuck door. On his
Id6, he rolls a 4. This isn't enough; it's not a 5 or
6. But he adds his +1 adjustment, his 4 becomes a 5, and suddenly it's enough: He can
budge the stuck door. Similarly, a character with
Strength 3 (adjustment ~3) tries a similarly
stuck door. On his Id6, he rolls a 5, normally a
success. But he must apply his ~3 adjustment
and his 5 suddenly becomes a 2, a failure.
Intelligence
High Intelligence affects the number of languages a character knows. If the DM is using the
optional general skills rules, high Intelligence al- so affects the number of general skills the character knows.
A human character of "average" Intelligence
(a score of 9-12) knows two languages: the Common tongue and an alignment tongue. The character can read and write those languages.
(The Common tongue is the "standard" tongue
for the campaign. A campaign set in modern
America would have English as its Common
tongue, for example.) Demihuman characters usually know additional languages, as described
for each demihuman character class.
If the character receives an adjustment from
an Intelligence over 12 (a bonus, in other
of the group. Lawful characters and monsters often act in predictable ways. Lawful behavior is
usually the same as "good" behavior.
Chaos (or Chaotic)
Chaos is the opposite of Law. It is the belief
that life is random and that chance and luck rule
the world. Laws are made to be broken, as long
as a person can get away with it. It is not important to keep promises, and lying and telling the
truth are both useful.
To a Chaotic creature, the individual is the
most important of all things. Selfishness is the
normal way of life, and the group is not important. Chaotics often act on sudden desires and
whims. They have strong belief in the power of
luck. They cannot always be trusted. Chaotic behavior is usually the same as behavior that could
be called "evil." Each individual player must decide if his Chaotic character is closer to a mean,
selfish "evil" personality or merely a happy-golucky, unpredictable personality.
Neutrality (or Neutral)
Neutrality is the belief that the world is a balance between Law and Chaos. It is important
that neither side get too much power and upset
this balance. The individual is important, but so
is the group; the two sides must work together.
A Neutral character is most interested in personal survival. Such characters believe in their
own wits and abilities rather than luck. They
tend to return the treatment they receive from
others. Neutral characters will join a party if they
think it is in their own best interest, but will not
be overly helpful unless there is some sort of
profit in it. Neutral behavior may be considered
"good" or "evil" (or neither).
Alignment Behavior
Take this situation as an example: A group of
player characters is attacked by a large number of
monsters. Escape is not possible unless the monsters are slowed down.
A Lawful character will fight to protect the
group, regardless of the danger. The character
will not run away unless the whole group does so
or is otherwise safe.
A Neutral character will fight to protect the
group as long as it is reasonably safe to do so. If
the danger is too great, the character will try to
save himself, even at the expense of the rest of
the party.
A Chaotic character might fight the monsters
or he might run away immediately—Chaotics
are, as always, unpredictable. The character may
not even care what happened to the rest of the
party.
Playing an alignment does not mean a character must do stupid things. A character should always act as intelligently as the Intelligence score
indicates, unless there is a reason to act otherwise
(such as a magical curse).
Alignment Languages
Each alignment has a secret language of passwords, hand signals, and other body motions.
Player characters and intelligent monsters always
know their alignment languages. They will also
recognize when another alignment language is
being spoken, but will not understand it. Alignment languages have no written form. A character may not learn a different alignment language
unless he changes alignments. In such a case, the
character forgets the old alignment language
and starts using the new one immediately.
Select Name,
Personality, and
Background
You may have been thinking about this all
during the character-creation process, but now
it's time to give your character his name, personality, and background—the traits which make
him a real character.
Name
You should give your character a name appropriate to the world in which he'll be adventuring. Ask your DM if his campaign setting is
based on any real-world civilization; if so, use a
name appropriate to that civilization. (If you're
not familiar with that civilization, ask your DM
for help.) Or if you are adventuring in an Arabian setting, such legendary names as Ali Baba,
Sinbad, and Saladin are appropriate names.
Many campaigns are straightforward fantasy
with elements drawn from a number of sources,
yet these campaigns may not be strongly based
in any of those sources. In that case, you need
merely make up a fantasy-sounding name and
ask the DM if it sounds appropriate to his campaign. Such names can be made up of
interesting-sounding syllables like Adragan or
Nissia. Or, and especially in the case of lyrically
named elves, they could be composed of descriptive words like Silverglade or Woodshadow.
Choose a name carefully. It should represent
the character in some way, or at least be a name
you like. You might find yourself playing this
character for years, and if you give him a silly or
inappropriate name, you might regret it later.
Personality
Alignment isn't all there is to a character's
personality. You should think about your character, about his mannerisms, the way he speaks,
the way he dresses, how he spends money, what
sort of people he likes, how he likes to spend his
non-adventuring time, and so on. The more attention you invest in imagining your character,
with all his traits, virtues, and vices, the more interesting and "real" you will make him. Sure,
it's useful for your character to be the mightiest
warrior in the world . . . but none of the other
player characters will care whether he lives or dies
unless he has a personality.
Background
At some point, you'll need to decide on your
character's background: where and when he was
born, how he was reared, who his family is, who
his friends were, and what he did up until the
time he enters play.
This isn't a solo effort—it's a cooperative effort between you and the DM. He knows more
about his campaign-world than you do; you
know more about your character than he does.
The two of you have to work together to integrate your character into his world.
This means that the DM may recommend or
even insist on some changes to your character
background in order to make him fit better into
the campaign world. You should normally accept
any recommendations that don't seriously interfere with your concept of your character, and
should negotiate on the ones which do.
For example, you may have decided that your
character's family lived in a small fishing village
in a small, distant island far, far away. Your DM
may prefer that he lived in a small fishing village
on the coast of the main continent, not quite so
isolated. This probably won't alter your character's personality or personal history, and will allow your DM to fit your character more easily
into the campaign, so this is the sort of change
you can acquiesce to without any worries.
But let's say your DM wants to establish something else about your character: That when he
was ten, a werewolf with a distinctive red-andsilver coat burst in through the door of the family hut and killed all the family except your
character, and that your character was raised by
the family of your mother's brother.
It's obvious here that your DM is setting you
up for some future encounter with that selfsame
werewolf—perhaps it will be far in the future, or
perhaps the hunt for that monster will be used as
the event which will bring all the player characters together in the first place. Whichever, he's
not trying to kill your character's family for frivolous reasons, but for reasons related to plot.
However, you've been imagining that your
character is emotionally strong and unscarred,
and still has a good relationship with his parents
and siblings, and the DM's changes would seriously affect your concept of your character. You
explain this to him. This is where negotiations
enter the picture.
He may counter, "All right, let's say instead
that the werewolf attacked the local pub, and
your father was among those killed. As the oldest son, you suddenly had to become the man of
the family, and now, after you've been the main
provider for years, your brothers and sisters are
old enough to take over, and you can leave to
make a life for yourself at last."
This still leaves your character with a tragedy
in his past, but he didn't lose his entire family,
and wasn't present to see his father destroyed by
the monster, which would tend to leave him
much healthier emotionally. So you could agree
to this change, and both your purposes and your
DM's are served.
Another thing you can do, and your DM may
be doing so as well, is to establish that your character already knows some of the other player
characters. Talk with the other players to find out
something about their characters. When the
players have come up with similar backgrounds,
you might suggest that those backgrounds intersected with yours, and then try to work out the
details. Perhaps another player thought of his
character as growing up in a fishing village, in
which case you might suggest that it be the same
as your character's. Perhaps another character
has been in the army, and you conceived of your
character as having briefly been a soldier. See if
you can put your character in the same unit.
This sort of thing helps establish connections
between your characters. These connections can
keep an adventuring group from falling apart
over trivial incidents of mistrust and confusion.
Determine Character
Height and Weight
The player can choose any height and weight
for his character which the DM agrees is appropriate. The Character Height and Weight Table
will give you an idea what height and weight
ranges are average for character races. For use
with later encumbrance rules, all character
weights are given in coin-weights: one coin
equals one-tenth of a pound, so a character
weighing 2,000 en actually weighs 200 Ibs.

Earn Experience
As characters go through a lot of adventures,
they gradually get better and better at what they
do. Everyone learns to fight better (especially
fighters). Everyone learns to withstand damage
better (more hit points and better saving
throws), and so forth. This is all accomplished
through the use of experience points and experience levels.
At the end of every game-session or complete
adventure story (the DM will decide which), the
Dungeon Master will award experience points
(abbreviated as "XP") to the characters. Experience points are awarded for accomplishing goals
in the course of the adventure story.
Every so often, a character will have earned
enough experience points to attain a higher experience level; this is often referred to as "going
up a level." Each time the character goes up a
level, he gains more abilities. Under no circumstances can a. character advance more than one
level per adventure; all experience beyond one
level of advancement can be retained up to one
point short of a two level advance. Any additional experience is lost.
Take a look at the Fighter Experience Table on
page 16, then return here.
As you can see on that table, a fighter with no
experience points (0 XP) is a 1st level fighter.
During his adventuring career, he'll earn experience points. Once he reaches 2,000 points, his
player should inform the DM that he's reached
his 2nd experience level; once he reaches 4,000
experience points, he can tell the DM that he's
reached 3rd level; and so on.
The number of experience points the character must earn becomes proportionately greater
and greater. Don't be alarmed by this. The character's rise through experience levels will slow
down, but not as much as this table suggests. As
he becomes tougher, he can undertake tougher
and tougher quests, which will earn him proportionately more experience points.
Hit Dice and Hit Points
After a character reaches 9th experience level
(often referred to as "Name" level), the player
no longer rolls dice to gain additional hit points
for the character: For each level of experience
earned, a given number of hit points (instead of
Hit Dice) will be gained. The number of hit
points gained each level (after 9th) will be shown
later in the next chapter; it differs from character
class to character class.
Each player will roll Hit Dice for his character
from 1st experience level to 9th (or 8th, in the
case of the halfling character, who can only go up
to 8th level). Starting with 10th level, the character will receive a pre-set number of hit points
appropriate for his character class.
Constitution adjustments to hit points apply
only to the Hit Dice the player rolls; they do not
apply to the hit points added at higher levels.
Maximum Levels and Experience Points
Dwarves and elves may not progress beyond
12th level. Halflings may only rise to 8th level.
Druids may only achieve 30th level (and only
then after a special challenge, which is described
in the next chapter), while mystics can only reach
16th level. The other four human classes (cleric,
fighter, magic-user, thief) may continue all the
way to 36th level.
Once a character reaches his maximum experience level, he does not stop earning experience
points. Characters can always earn more experience points. Players should keep records of all
the experience points their characters earn.
Prime Requisites and
Experience Points
If your character's prime requisite is high
enough, he will get extra experience points. The
Experience Bonuses and Penalties Table will
serve as your rule of thumb for calculating how
much extra experience clerics, fighters, magicusers, and thieves get for high prime requisites.

For example, a fighter's prime requisite is
Strength. If he has a Strength of 3-5, he loses
20% of all the experience points he earns. If he
has a Strength of 6-8, he loses 10%. If his
Strength is 13-15, he earns an extra 5%. And if
his Strength is 16-18, he earns an extra 10%.
If a fighter with a Strength of 16 were to be
given 100 points of experience, his player would
add in an extra 10% (for a total of 110 experience points) before writing the amount down on
his character sheet.
Calculating Experience Bonuses
Unless your DM tells you otherwise, you will
always calculate your character's experience bonus .. . or experience penalty. However, some
DMs prefer to keep a close eye on characters' experience gains, and may decide to calculate all
such bonuses themselves. In such a case, the DM
needs to tell his players about this decision ahead
of time; otherwise they might accidentally add
in their experience bonuses again.

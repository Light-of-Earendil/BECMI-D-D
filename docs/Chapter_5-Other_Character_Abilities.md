wo types or special abilities (called weapon
mastery and general skills) can be used by
player characters in campaign games. These two
sets of abilities are optional; the Dungeon Master decides whether they will be used in his or
her world.
Weapon mastery is a character's ability to use
weapons with greater skill than the game normally allows. All characters, not just fighters,
can learn to use weapon mastery.
General skills are abilities that characters can
learn and use in the campaign. Few general skills
are useful in combat, but many are helpful
throughout the course of a campaign; they also
help define the character and make him or her
seem more real.
Weapon Mastery
In the D&D® combat system, each character
automatically knows how to use every weapon
available to his character class for use. The following system gives player characters the option
to either study one weapon in depth or to study a
few weapons to a less intense degree. When a
character is using the weapon(s) he has mastered, he has an advantage over those who have
not studied these weapons.
Weapon Choices
With the weapon mastery rules, when a human character is started, he does not know how
to use any weapons. He is given weapon choices
so that he may choose to learn individual weapons. Demihumans do not gain or use weapon
choices; due to their longer lifespans and
wilderness-oriented lifestyles, demihuman characters start with basic skill in all weapons not restricted from their classes. However,
demihumans can increase their weapon mastery
through training, as outlined below.
Number of Weapon Choices
Fighters start off at 1st level with four weapon
choices; all other character classes start off with
two.
Human characters gain one new weapon
choice at each of the following experience levels:
3,6,9, 11, 15, 23, 30, and 36. Fighters also gain
weapon choices at levels 19, 27, and 33. All characters gain one new weapon choice for every
200,000 experience points they earn above their
maximum experience level.
The Weapon Choices by Experience Level Table shows the character's number of weapon
choices.
What to Do With Weapon Choices
For each weapon choice he has, a character
may choose to learn one weapon at the basic
level of ability. By "one weapon," we mean precisely that—one weapon from the Weapons Mastery Table used in one fashion only. One
weapon, for example, might mean a "normal
sword"; it does not mean "all swords."
When a weapon can be used in two different
fashions (i.e., one-handed and two-handed, as
with the bastard sword), a weapon choice buys
only one of those fashions. A character can have
different levels of mastery, for example, with
one-handed bastard swords and two-handed
bastard swords, depending on how he has allotted his weapon choices. One exception is the
net; training with the net allows a character to
use small nets one-handed and larger nets twohanded, so the net has only one entry on the
Weapons Mastery Table.
Basic level of ability is the same level of ability
you're already familiar with; basic level allows
the character to use the weapon effectively by
doing the damage and special functions listed on
the Weapons Table in Chapter 4. However, a
character does not have to use every weapon
choice he has to buy basic level of ability with a
new weapon. Instead, he can choose to specialize
by applying his weapon choices to a weapon he
already knows, thus improving his ability with
that weapon. These degrees of ability are called
levels of mastery and are listed in the Levels of
Weapon Mastery Table.
At 1st experience level, a character must
spend all his weapon choices on different weapons; he may not yet progress beyond basic ability
with any weapon. He may spend subsequent
weapon choices to either buy basic ability with a
new weapon or to gain the opportunity to improve his level of mastery with a weapon he already knows.
In general, the higher a character's level of
mastery with a weapon, the more damage he
does with the weapon and the greater number of
special results he can achieve with the weapon.
The different levels of mastery are detailed under "Training," next.
Training
Although characters can gain basic levels of
mastery simply by expending weapon choices,
characters cannot attain higher levels in the same
way. Once the character has spent his 1st level
choices, to gain additional knowledge of the use
of a weapon he must be trained by someone who
has equal or greater knowledge of that specific
weapon. That someone could be another PC,
but it is usually an NPC teacher found during
adventures or through word-of-mouth. In some
campaigns, weapon masters run academies
where they teach the proper use of specific weapons; sword academies are common. In other
campaigns, mystics may allow nonmystics to
learn at their monasteries; many mystics are
weapon masters.
Demihumans can train to reach higher levels
of weapon mastery just as human characters can.
However, demihumans are eligible to train only
at levels 4 and 8 (and level 12 for dwarves) and at
every 200,000 experience points after reaching
their maximum level.
After finding a trainer who will provide the
necessary instruction, the student must pay all of
the required costs before training can begin. The
costs and time required for weapon training vary
by the level of mastery sought, and they are listed in the Training Times and Costs Table.
A student can train only to the next rank of
ability above his own. He can go from Basic to
Skilled, for example, and next time go from
Skilled to Expert, but he can never jump straight
from Basic to Expert.
A student can train in the hope of achieving
the next level of mastery—and yet fail to do so.
The student character has a chance of failure applied to each training period. His chances of success and failure vary by the mastery levels of
himself and his trainer, as given in the Chance of
Training Success Table. From the character's perspective, failure may occur because the trainer
has insufficient knowledge or lacks the ability to
train others or because the student cannot fully
absorb the new information.
Failure does nor mean that the character has
lost his weapon choice for that experience level.
The weapon choice is still there, and it's still
dedicated to the weapon and level of mastery he
has chosen for it. The student has lost the time
and money he has spent, but he may spend more
time and money until he reaches the level of
mastery for which he has spent his weapon
choice.
The chance of success is checked halfway

through the training period, and the student is
immediately informed of the results. (In the
role-playing situation, this usually consists of the
teacher taking the student aside and telling him
that he is not ready yet and that it is useless for
him to continue at this time.) The student may
then either continue (despite his teacher's recommendation) or stop the training.
If the success roll failed but the student decides to continue training for the full period, the
student may then study the same level again but
with a different trainer, and his chance of success
is increased by 10%.
If the student chooses to stop the training
midway, he may then study the same level with a
different master at the same chance for success.
The two advantages to this option are that the
character does not lose the rest of the time he
would spend with the first teacher and that the
first teacher normally refunds half the cost of
training. (Chaotic teachers might not offer refunds.)
As you can see from the Chance of Training
Success Table, it is possible (1% chance) for a
character to learn a superior level of weapon mastery from a teacher who is actually the character's
equal. (Such unusual training matches usually
end up with the teacher realizing and announcing that his student has surpassed him: "Now,
you are the master, and I am the student!")
However, learning from an equal-level teacher is
very difficult to do. Whenever possible, the student should find a teacher who is more skilled
than he is; when that isn't possible, however, he
will have to train with a teacher who is his equal.
At the more advanced levels, characters are
likely to train with their equals and just as likely
to fail their chance to succeed the first time
around. Most characters will choose to finish
training with that teacher anyway so that they
will have a 10% bonus with the next teacher
they train under. Obviously, it takes quite a
while to attain the grand master level of competency.
Unskilled Weapons Use
A character who is not trained in any weapon
(i.e., he has not devoted even one weapon choice
to a weapon) is classified as unskilled.
If an unskilled character uses a weapon, the
weapon has its basic mastery characteristics and
bonuses or penalties, but it does only half damage. Thus, if an unskilled character uses a weapon that does 1d8 points of damage, he will roll
1d8 and then halve the result (rounding fractions down) for the actual damage. Missile weapons used at the unskilled mastery level also
receive a - 1 penalty to attack rolls.
Skilled Weapons Use
When using the weapon mastery rules, the
weapons from last chapter's Weapons Table acquire new abilities and damage ranges. All these
new bonuses, damage types, and special uses are
given in the Weapons Mastery Table in this chapter. Weapons that were nearly identical in the
previous rules become much more distinctive
here.
Characters might choose to specialize in a particular weapon because of its better damage
against weapon-using opponents, or they might
choose a weapon for its special uses (such as parrying blows or tripping opponents).
The DM may modify the Weapons Mastery Table if he chooses, either by adjusting listed weapon characteristics or by adding new weapons. He
should not add any new weapons that are significantly more powerful than the ones listed in the
table; new weapons should be assigned balanced
benefits and weaknesses.
Types of Benefits
Characters gain several benefits from weapon
mastery. These benefits include extra damage,
attack roll bonuses, improved range with missiles and thrown weapons, ability to throw some
hand-to-hand weapons, bonuses to armor class,
and other special results (stunning, paralysis, entanglement, etc.).
Applying Benefits
Some maneuvers and special weapon effects in
these rules provide bonuses to attack rolls in
combat. These benefits are applied before other
modifiers. Using this method, high-experience
fighters and demihumans might gain enough
bonuses to bring the attack roll needed to 2 or
less, activating their Multiple Attacks option.
(Multiple Attacks are described in the "Combat
Maneuvers" section in Chapter 8.)
Other weapon mastery benefits can be applied
during the normal course of the combat sequence. Benefits such as the greater damage
available can be a crucial factor when doubled by
a thief's Backstab ability.
Some benefits can occur only if the player announces that his character is deliberately using
them (such as deflecting, disarming, etc.). The
player must always tell the DM he is using one of
these options. He must mention this use before
he rolls to hit. It is too late to mention it after the
die has been cast.
Armor class bonuses gained through weapon
mastery should be applied automatically in all
applicable situations. However, players may
want to remind the DM once or twice.
Attack and Defense Benefits
There are a number of attack and defense
benefits available to characters when using the
weapon mastery rules. These are outlined in the
following text.
Opponent Type and Damage Bonuses
Many damage increases and attack roll bonuses vary with the type of opponent. Opponents that attack with two-handed missile fire
devices have similar defenses to those that attack
with natural body weaponry. This type of opponent is designated "M" (for Missile or Monster)
on the Weapons Mastery Table.
Defense is very different for opponents using
hand-held weapons that are swung (such as
swords and axes) or thrown (such as daggers and
bolas) and opponents using missile-fire weapons
that need only one hand (slings, short blowguns,
preloaded light crossbows). On the Weapons
Mastery Table, these opponents are designated
"H" (for Hand-held).
If an opponent could fit into both categories
(such as a wererat carrying a sword, who has both
natural body weaponry and a hand-held weapon), the character attacking that opponent uses
his weapon's damage results that are most favorable to the opponent (not to the attacker!).
However, if this type of opponent drops the
weapon it holds, it immediately becomes category M for all calculations.
Most weapons are better when attacking one
or the other of these defense categories. On the
Weapons Mastery Table, each weapon's listing
shows a primary opponent (the category of defense against which the weapon is most effective)
and a secondary opponent (the other category,
against which it is less effective). A few weapons
are equally good against both target types; they
bear the table notation [P = A], where "A"
stands for All.
Attack Roll Bonuses
Characters with skilled or better weapon masteries receive bonuses to the attack roll with the
mastered weapons, as noted in the Attack Roll
Bonuses Table. When the character successfully
completes training and achieves a new level of
weapon mastery, he gains his new applicable attack roll bonuses and all other special weapon
benefits from the new level of mastery (listed in
the Weapons Mastery Table and described in the
weapon descriptions section below).

Even with the additional bonuses gained from
weapon mastery, don't forget to apply a character's Strength adjustment to all melee attack rolls
and to melee and thrown-weapon damage rolls.
Also apply his Dexterity adjustment to all
thrown and missile attack rolls.
Improved Range
A character at skilled or better mastery with a
ranged weapon can often fire or hurl it farther
than someone less accomplished. All notes on
improved weapon ranges are on the Weapons
Mastery Table. Remember that the ranges for
thrown and missile weapons are calculated in
feet in indoor settings and in yards in outdoor
combat.
Throwing Ability With Hand-to-Hand Weapons
Weapon masters can throw some weapons that
other character's can't throw effectively. Masters of
battle axes, clubs and torches, war hammers, bastard swords, normal swords, and short swords can
throw these in combat starting at the expert level
of mastery. Ranges for these weapons are given on
the Weapons Mastery Table, and there are rules
for rarely thrown weapons after the table.
Bonuses to the Wielder's Armor Class
When a character is using a weapon he has
mastered, he gains an armor class bonus (above
any he might receive from his armor or defensive
maneuvers). The armor class bonus he receives
applies only to a given number of attacks per
round. That number is given on the Weapons
Mastery Table, and it may apply to M (Missile/
Monster) attackers, H (Hand-held) attackers, or
A (All) attackers, as shown on the table. For example, if the table says that the character has M:
-2AC/2, it means that he gets a — 2 armor class
bonus against the first two attacks made against
him that round by missiles or monster attackers.
Likewise, A: —6AC/3 indicates that the character gets a - 6 armor class bonus against the first
three attacks made against him that round by
any missile or monster attacker.
Some shields do not have a number after a
slash mark; that means that the shield provides
the character an additional armor class benefit all
the time the shield is held, not just for a certain
number of attacks per round.
Having an armor class bonus does not count as
a maneuver; the character may still move and attack at normal rates.
Defensive Maneuvers
In addition to the above armor class bonuses,
a character may have an armor class adjustment
due to Fighting Withdrawal and Parry defensive
maneuvers, as described in Chapter 8.
Special Results
Weapon masters can do some amazing things
with their weapons; they get "more performance" out of the weapons they've mastered.
Most of the special results are listed in the "Special Effects" column of the Weapons Mastery Table and are described in the section on
descriptions of special effects, which follows the
table.
However, one special result is common to all
weapons: the despair effect.
Despair Effect
A weapon master's amazing ability with his
weapon can cause despair and fear in some opponents. This is called the despair effect. When it
happens, the targets affected must make a
standard morale check (described in Chapter 8).
Opponents must be above animal intelligence to
be affected.
Targets that fail their morale rolls try to flee or
surrender at their next opportunity. The DM
should describe the expressions of the monsters
who've had to make special despair morale
checks, but he or she shouldn't describe whether
the monsters successfully made their rolls until
it's time for them to act.
When to Roll for Despair: The DM should
have affected monsters and NPCs make their
morale rolls under any of the following circumstances:
• The weapon user inflicts maximum possible
damage with his weapon.
• The weapon user avoids all damage in a round
by deflecting the opponent's blows. (Deflecting is described in the section on descriptions
of special effects after the Weapons Mastery
Table.)
• The weapon user disarms two or more opponents in the same round.
The DM may choose to check for despair during other special situations if he desires.
PC Victims of Despair: Player characters under a despair effect must make a saving throw vs.
death ray. If they succeed, they are merely impressed; those who fail must retreat in awe for
1d6 rounds.
Numbers Affected: The despair effect can only affect a certain number of enemies at a time.
This varies with the character's level of mastery as
follows:
Basic—no despair effect possible.
Skilled—up to 4 hit dice or levels.
Expert—up to 8 hit dice or levels.
Master—up to 12 hit dice or levels.
Grand Master—up to 16 hit dice or levels.
When the despair effect is turned on a group,
it always affects the lowest-level (or lowest-HD)
enemies first.
Frequency of Use: A weapon master can only
use his despair ability once per fight (once the
current situation leaves the combat sequence,
the fight is over).
Other Notes
When choosing a character's weapons, keep
the character in mind; be sure to select the weapons the character (not necessarily the player!)
would choose. Be aware of standard weapon restrictions. Halflings can only use small weapons,
for example.
Weapons that do a wide range of damage are
present in each category. Low damage is usually
offset by special benefits. Once a suitable weapon is found, review the other weapons within
that category with comparable damage or special
effects and consider the weapon's potential
(available with further training). Weapon mastery choices, once taken, cannot be changed.
Remember that weapon mastery bonuses apply only when the character is using the weapon
he has mastered, not when he uses other weapons, even similar ones.
How to Read the Weapon
Mastery Table
The columns on the table provide the following information:
Weapon: This column gives not only the
weapon name but also many other details about
its use; compare the symbols beneath the weapon name to the list of abbreviations at the bottom of the table.
Lvl: This heading stands for "level of mastery." Each weapon has statistics listed for five
different levels of mastery. If your character has
expert mastery with a normal sword, he'd find
the entry for normal sword and skip down to the
line labeled "EX" (for Expert) in this column.
Ranges: This column shows the weapon's
range when thrown or launched. Not all weapons have ranges listed. Note that the weapon's
range increases with each new level of mastery.
Damage: This column shows the damage the
weapon does. Damage, too, increases with each
new level of mastery. This column often has separate entries for "P" and "S"—the weapon does
different amounts of damage to its primary and
secondary target types.
Defense: This column shows the effects the
weapon has on the armor class of its wielder.
Special Effects: This column summarizes the
weapon's special abilities; you will need to read
the text after the table to understand what these
notations mean. Certain weapons have an additional symbol ("§") in this column; this symbol
indicates that these weapons have special effects
beyond the other weapons' special effects. Read
the following text for more information on these
particular weapons.
The "§" Notation
Five weapons—the blackjack, blowgun, bola,
net, and whip—are listed on the Weapons Mastery Table with an "§" symbol in their "Special
Effects" column. This means you need to refer
to the following Special Effects Tables to see
what else these weapons do to their victims.
Special Effects Descriptions
The special effects listed for weapons in the
Weapons Mastery Table are described here and
are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.
Breaks: Whenever the wielder of a shield
weapon or his foe rolls the exact number needed
to hit the other, there is a chance that one of the
shield weapon's blades will break. With a subsequent roll of 5 or less on 1d10, a blade breaks.
Charge: If the wielder charges 20 yards or
more and strikes his target, the victim takes double damage.
Death: The victim is reduced to 0 hit points.
Deflect: In addition to any attacks, the wielder of this weapon may attempt to deflect the
number of melee and thrown weapon attacks indicated in one round. To deflect each attack, the
character must make a saving throw vs. death
ray.
Delay: The victim hit by this weapon must
make a saving throw or lose initiative the next
round. If the type of saving throw is not specified, it is a saving throw vs. paralysis. For missile
attacks, this effect occurs only at the indicated
ranges.
Disarm: The wielder of this weapon may attempt to disarm an opponent instead of making
a normal attack. The attacker must roll to hit the
target. The victim can save his weapon by rolling
less than or equal to his Dexterity on 1d20. If the
attacker has the Disarm Combat option, the victim must add a +5 penalty to his die roll. The
DM should determine Dexterity scores for NPCs
and monsters or else assume a Dexterity score of
11. In addition, for each level of mastery the attacker has gained beyond basic, the victim suffers a penalty of +1 to his roll vs. the effect.
Double Damage: On a natural roll of the
number(s) indicated, the weapon inflicts double
damage.
Entangle: An entangled victim cannot attack,
cast spells, or move. The victim may make a saving throw vs. death ray each round to escape.
Hook: Instead of making a normal attack, the
wielder of this weapon may attempt to hook and
pull down a foe. The attacker must roll to hit.
This causes the minimum damage possible for
the weapon; the victim must make a saving
throw vs. paralysis or fall down. A +4 bonus to
attack rolls applies when attacking a fallen foe. A
fallen foe also has a —4 penalty to all saving
throws and a - 2 penalty to attack rolls while on
the ground. A character can stand up in one
round.
Ignite: Fire has a chance to ignite anything
flammable that it hits. The chance is equal to
5% (rolled on 1dl00) per point of damage
caused in each round. If an item ignites it will
burn for 1d6 rounds causing 1d4 points of damage each round.
Knockout: The victim is rendered unconscious
for 1dl00 rounds.
No Off-Hand Penalty: If a campaign is using
the optional Two Weapons Combat rules (see
Chapter 8 and consult the DM), the cestus does
not take a - 4 penalty or the -1 weapon mastery level penalties when used in the off-hand. If
the character uses two cesti, he can strike with
both weapons at the same chance for success.
Paralysis: Paralysis freezes a creature in place
for 1-6 turns. A paralyzed creature is aware of
what is happening but cannot move, attack,
talk, or cast spells. Any cure spell can negate the
effects of paralysis, but they do not cure damage
in addition to removing the paralysis.
Poison: See the Special Effects Tables OneThree for effects.
Second Attack: The wielder is able to make a
second attack with this shield weapon while attacking with another one-handed weapon in his

other hand. This second attack is made with no
off-hand penalty.
Set vs. Charge: If the wielder is aware of a
charging enemy, he may set this weapon against
the charge. A charge only takes place when the
enemy rushes the wielder at 20 yards (or more)
this round. If the wielder's weapon hits the
charging foe, it inflicts double listed damage.
Skewer: If the target has no more than the
number of Hit Dice indicated, the wielder of
this weapon may decide to skewer him instead of
strike him normally. A normal attack consists of
striking the target and withdrawing the trident
for another attack; with the skewer, the attacker
thrusts his trident into the target and twists it so
that it is not easily extracted. Once the weapon
hits, it is stuck; it will remain stuck for ld4 + 4
(5-8) rounds, after which time the victim's
movements will cause it to come free. For each
round a victim remains skewered, he automatically takes 1d6 points of damage.
Slow: The victim is slowed and can move and
attack at only half his normal movement rates.
He can cast no spells while slowed.
Strangle: If the attacker makes a natural roll of
the number(s) indicated, the victim must make
a successful saving throw vs. death ray or become
immediately paralyzed and die in ld6 + 2 (3-8)
rounds unless rescued. If the victim escapes, he
survives but remains paralyzed for 2d6 (2-12)
rounds.
Stun: If the victim is approximately the same
size as the attacker or smaller, he is stunned if he
fails a saving throw vs. death ray. A stunned
character moves at 1/3 speed and cannot attack or
cast spells. The character also has a +2 armor
class penalty and a — 2 saving throw penalty. A
stunned character can make a saving throw vs.
death ray each round to recover from the stun
effect. For missile weapons, this effect occurs only at the specified ranges.
Individual Weapon
Descriptions
Some of the weapons on the Weapons Mastery
Table are marked with either one or two asterisks. When a weapon is marked with one asterisk
(*), refer to last chapter's Weapon Descriptions
to learn about the item's special characteristics.
If a weapon is marked with two asterisks (**),
that weapon is described here. Items are arranged alphabetically for your convenience.
Blowguns: A victim hit by a poisoned blowgun dart fired by someone with skilled or better
weapon mastery makes his saving throws at a
penalty. The weapon master knows how to accurately fire the dart into veins, arteries, and other
critical areas, thus introducing the poison more
quickly into the bloodstream.
Polearms, Other: The last chapter mentioned
that traits of the halberd, pike, and poleaxe
could be combined to individualize the other
types of polearm mentioned. This is an optional
rule to be used if the DM wishes these weapons
to be individualized. These additional polearms
are detailed as follows:
Bardiche: This polearm uses halberd statistics
but also has the deflect abilities of the pike. The
bardiche may be set vs. a charge.
Bill: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics and
deflect scores. In addition, the bill has the hook
ability of a halberd.
Gisarme: This polearm uses pike statistics and
deflect scores. The gisarme also has the hook
ability of a halberd.
Glaive: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics
and deflect scores. The glaive causes double
damage like a dagger. This weapon may be set
vs. a charge.
Lochaber Axe: This polearm follows all of the
halberd rules, but the lochaber axe may also stun
at the highest two masteries.
Partizan: This weapon follows all the pike
rules, but the partizan may also disarm. This
weapon may be set vs. a charge.
Ranseur: This polearm uses halberd statistics
and deflect scores. The ranseur may also be used
to disarm at skilled level and above. This weapon
may be set vs. a charge.
Spetum: This weapon uses pike statistics and
deflect scores. The spetum may also disarm at
skilled or greater mastery. It may be set vs. a
charge.
Spontoon: This polearm uses spear statistics,
but it may not be thrown. It uses the deflect
scores of a halberd. The spontoon does double
damage like a dagger and may be set vs. a
charge.
Voulge: This weapon uses poleaxe statistics,
but it causes +2 points of damage. The voulge
uses the deflect scores for a halberd. It may cause
double damage like a dagger.
Throwing Rarely Thrown
Weapons
Several of the weapons listed in the Weapons
Mastery Table, while normally used in melee,
can be thrown by a wielder at high levels of mastery in desperate situations.
To throw these weapons, the attacker must
make a normal attack roll modified by Strength
(but not by Dexterity).
Since the maneuver is unexpected, the attacker first checks to see if his foe is surprised (a roll
of 1 or 2 on 1d6). If the victim is not surprised,
the victim makes a saving throw vs. death ray to
reduce damage by half. If he is surprised or if he
fails his saving throw, he takes full damage from
the attack.
Retroactive Weapon
Mastery
If a campaign has already begun but the DM
would like to add weapon mastery to it, it's not
too late. The DM should start by carefully examining each character. Characters often have a few
favorite weapons. Assume that these are the
character's preferences; these will be the weapons for which the character has learned increased
mastery, while the knowledge of the proper use
of other weapons has faded through lack of use.
The DM may then give the character the number of weapon choices appropriate for his class
and experience level. Weapons that are the character's personal trademark can be bought up to
expert mastery; weapons that the character uses
frequently can be bought up to skilled mastery;
weapons that the character has been known to
use effectively should be bought to basic masGeneral Skills
General skills are abilities that characters can
use in the campaign. There are many general
skills, but no character will have more than a few
of them, so a character's choice of skills will help
make him more distinctive and more individually useful in some campaign situations.
Using general skills is optional. If the DM
doesn't want to use them in his or her campaign,
they won't be used.
Beginning Skills
All 1st level characters start with four "blank"
skills, often called slots. (When a skill is chosen,
it stops being a slot.)
Characters who have an Intelligence of more
than 12 start with more than four skill slots. If
the character has an Intelligence of 13-15, he
gets 1 additional skill slot; if his Intelligence is
16-17, he gets 2 additional skill slots; and if his
Intelligence is 18, he gets 3 additional skill slots.
Different things determine which skills are
chosen to fill the character's slots. The player
may choose some or all of the skills to fill his
available skill slots. Or the DM may insist that
the player select certain skill choices appropriate
for the character background the player has chosen.

tery. If the character still has any weapon choices
left, his player can assign them as he pleases to
buy Basic masteries with other weapons; he cannot buy higher than basic mastery for these additional weapons.
When fitting these rules into an existing campaign, the DM should not allow a character to
buy a weapon skill above expert level unless the
character is at 24th experience level or greater.
He or she should not allow a character to buy a
weapon skill above master level unless the character is already 30th level or better.
Refer to "Reality Shift" in Chapter 13 for additional suggestions about coping with sudden
retroactive changes in a campaign.
Weapon-Using Monsters
Monsters may use weapon mastery rules if
they ordinarily use weapons to attack. Just as
with player characters, a monster must find a
trainer willing to teach it. Its maximum possible
skill is determined by its Intelligence, as given in
the Mastery Limits for Weapon-Using Monsters
Table. (See Chapter 13 for advice on determining monster Intelligence scores.)
Note that only humans and demihumans can
become grand masters; monsters cannot.
How Skills Are Used
Each skill is based on one of the character's
ability scores (Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom,
Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma).
Whenever the DM feels a character's selected
skill is appropriate to a game situation, he or she
will ask the player to roll 1d20 against the corresponding ability score. This is called a skill roll or
skill check. If the roll on the 1d20 is equal to or
less than the ability score, the skill use succeeds.
A roll of 20 always fails, no matter how high the
chance for success.
Example: If the character is riding a horse and
the horse is suddenly spooked and begins rearing, the DM will decide that the character's Riding skill is appropriate to check in this situation.
The player will roll 1d20 against his skill-related
ability score (Dexterity). If the character's Dexterity is 15, the player has only to roll a 15 or less
to use his Riding skill successfully.
Successfully rolling the skill normally allows
the character to accomplish the task he is attempting. For instance, if a character is trying to
track an animal through the forest and he successfully makes his Tracking skill check, then he
is able to follow the tracks of his prey.
Sample Skills
The Sample Skills Table lists a number of skills
appropriate to most D&D® game campaigns.
The players and the DM may add skills to this list
as the DM sees fit. The DM determines which
ability score pertains to each new skill.
Skills Descriptions
The skills listed in the Sample Skills Table are
described here and are arranged alphabetically
for your convenience. Roll skill rolls against the
ability under which these skills were listed in the
table.
Acrobatics: The character with this skill can
perform impressive acrobatic feats, balance on
taut ropes and wires, etc. A successful skill roll is
required to perform any acrobatic feat; failure
may result in the character falling. A successful
roll allows a character to reduce the effective
height of a fall by 10'. A DM can give an acrobatic character a +2 to save vs. mechanical traps
where agility would help—such as tilting floors
and pit traps. Many entertainers, thieves, and
nimble warriors have this skill. This skill is not
the equal of a mystic's acrobatics ability, but the
mystic's special ability can be presumed to include this skill; a mystic does not have to purchase the acrobatics skill.
Acting: This is the ability to make one's living
as a stage actor, but it also imparts the ability to
assume a different personality or to show false
emotions. Successful use of this skill allows a
character to tell convincing lies over a limited
period of time.
Alchemy: This skill provides the ability to recognize and identify common alchemical substances, potions, and poisons. Success with this
skill will allow a character to create an antidote
potion for one specific type of poison—if the
DM says that this is possible in his campaign.
Alertness: Successful uses of this skill allow the

character to draw a weapon without losing any
time, to avoid the effects of surprise, and to
wake up at the slightest out-of-place noise. Alternate Magics: This skill gives a character
basic familiarity with magics that are not related
to standard spellcasting. It includes knowing
many magical abilities of well-known Prime
Plane and extraplanar monsters and of Immortal
beings. The DM defines what types of knowledge this skill provides in his or her campaign.
Animal Training (choose type): The character
knows how to raise, train, and care for one type
of animal. The animal can be taught some sim- ple tricks or simple orders. A character who
wants to train two or more different animal types
must choose this skill more than once—Horse
Training is one skill, Dog Training is another.
However, a horse trainer can train any sort of
natural horse or pony and a dog trainer can train
any breed of dog. Any culture that features a
strong bond with some animal type will have
many members with the corresponding Animal
Training skill.
Art: This is the skill of creating art. There are
several different types of Art skill (painting, sculpture, woodcarving, mosaic, etc.). The player must specify one sort of art his character practices; a character can take the skill several times and be proficient in several different forms of
art. Art skill can be used to improve the reaction of NPCs to the party; if the artist can present an NPC with a portrait or sculpture of that person
(and make his Art roll), the artist receives a + 2
to reaction. The player can choose for his character's Art skill to be based on Wisdom instead of
Intelligence.
Artillery: A character must have this skill if he
is to command the crew of a piece of artillery
(catapult or trebuchet). He does not have to
make his skill roll with each shot; merely know- ing the skill is enough. The DM can call on him
to make his skill roll each time the character or
the crew aims at a new target; the skill allows the
character to make all pertinent calculations of
trajectory, distance, and throw weight. This skill can alternatively allow the character
to oversee the building and repair of all varieties
of siege equipment. The character cannot know
both how to build and how to effectively operate
artillery weapons unless he takes the skill twice.
Bargaining: A successful skill roll allows a
character to get the best deal available for goods,
services, or information. It's not usually possible
for a character to bargain someone into giving
him very much for nothing. Blind Shooting: This skill is the ability to
shoot at a target without being able to see it; it is
typically used when the character is in darkness
or when the target is outside the range of his
sight or infravision. The character must be able
to hear the target so that its position can be evaluated. If the character makes his skill check, he
can then fire at the target; he needs an attack roll
to hit the target, but the character doesn't suffer
the normal darkness penalties. Bravery: With a successful use of this skill, the
character can resist the effects of any magical
fear. An NPC using this skill successfully can ignore the results of morale checks or of skills such
as Intimidation. Caving: This is an ability to always know
where one is while exploring underground caves,
cavern complexes, rivers, etc. A character with
this skill will automatically know the route he
has taken to get where he is (if he was conscious
all the time). Many dwarves have this skill.
The Caving skill can also be used in a maze.
Skill checks are necessary when the character has
become disoriented. If he is forced to flee for a
long stretch, he must make a skill check to keep
from being lost. (Characters without this skill
automatically become lost in such a situation.)
Ceremony (choose specific Immortal): A character with this skill knows how to honor an Immortal through ritual and ceremony; the skill
allows a cleric character to perform normal rituals of his clerical order and could even (if the DM
allows) permit a character to gain an Immortal's
attention (through devout prayer, fasting, sacrifice of possessions, etc.). This skill includes
knowing the code of behavior and the rituals
pleasing to the Immortal. In earlier D&D® game products, this skill was
often referred to as "Honor (specific immortal)."
Cheating: This is the skill of winning at gambling games by cheating—by dealing cards from
the bottom of the deck, etc. The cheating char- acter should make his Cheating skill roll; each
character he plays with can make one skill roll
(Cheating at the normal level, Gambling at a
- 1 penalty, or a base Intelligence check at a -4
penalty, whichever is best) against the character's
cheating roll. If one or more of the other players
makes his roll lower than the cheater does (see
"Using Skills Against Each Other" in this chapter), he detects the cheating. This skill is limited
to characters of Chaotic alignment. Craft (choose type): The character knows one
type of craft; examples include armor-making,
bow-making, tattooing, leatherworking, smithing, weapon-making, etc. The character must
choose which one type of craft the skill pertains
to; of course, he can spend more slots and have
several types of craft skills.
The character can make his living at this profession and, with a successful roll, make expert
opinions on subjects pertaining to his skill.
Danger Sense: A successful skill roll means
that the character can detect an imminent danger. The character will not know the nature or
source of the danger. The DM, not the player,
makes the skill roll, and he or she should not tell
the player that a roll has been made unless the
roll is a success (and there is danger present).
Deceiving: This is the ability to persuade a listener of the "truth" and sincerity of what the
speaker is saying, despite the fact that the skill
user is lying through his teeth. Successful use of
this skill causes an NPC to believe an untrue
statement or to accept a misleading statement as
honest and sincere. Failure indicates that the
character sounds unconvincing. This skill cannot
be used on player characters.
Detect Deception: This is the ability to recognize deceptive behavior in an NPC. This does
not reveal the truth or falsehood of specific statements, the motivations of the speaker, or the exact nature of the deception. This skill only warns
the character to distrust the deceptive NPC. The
DM makes the skill roll for the character, informing him of the result. The skill does not work on
player characters. Disguise: This is the ability to make a character look like someone else. A successful Disguise
check is required for each character or group of
characters that the disguised character is trying
to fool with his disguise. The target that the disguised character is trying to fool must make a
Wisdom roll against the Disguise roll in order to
penetrate the disguise (see "Using Skills Against
Each Other" at the end of this chapter).
Endurance: This skill gives the character the
ability to perform a tiring task for long periods of
time. A successful check means that the character is able to run (or perform some demanding
task) for an hour without collapsing. The character must make another check each hour he performs the task, with a cumulative penalty of +1
for each extra hour. Once the character has completed his task or fails a skill roll and collapses,
he must rest for three times the amount of time
he was performing that task. Engineering: This is the skill of planning, designing, and building large constructions such as
houses, bridges, dams, and so forth. Unless built
under the eye of a trained engineer, a large
structure—whether built by manpower and materials or pure magic—will inevitably collapse or
suffer some other calamity. Engineering skill can
also be used to evaluate constructions the party is
passing through or over: what shape they're in,
when and by whom they were built, and so on.
Escape: The character is often able to get loose
when tied or locked up. A successful skill roll
means that the character is able to get rid of his
ties. Another roll is needed to open a locked
door. The DM can apply bonuses and penalties
to the check based on the quality of the ropes
and knots, the intricacy of the lock, the lack of
lockpicking tools, etc.
Fire-Building: This is the ability to start a fire
without a tinderbox. A character with a tinderbox and this skill is able to start fires automatically (no roll necessary) in ordinary conditions. If
the character is trying to build a fire without a
tinderbox, he will eventually succeed; he must
make a 1d6 roll each round, and on a 1 or 2 he
ignites the fire. If the character is trying to build
a fire in adverse conditions (during high winds or
using wet wood), he must make a skill check
with penalties assigned by the DM.
Food Tasting: This is the ability to taste food
and water to see if they have spoiled. Thus the
character can avoid suffering from food poisoning by carefully tasting his food first. This ability
will not detect poisons added to a dish unless the
DM determines that the poison has a taste (in
which case it may be too late anyway).
Gambling: This is the ability to win money in
games of skill (competitive card games, for ex- ample) and betting. This involves honest games
(cheating is covered elsewhere), and a successful
check increases the character's chances for winning money at the games.
Healing: This is the ability to treat wounds
and diagnose illnesses among humans and demihumans. A successful skill roll allows a character
to restore 1d3 hit points to a wounded character. (A related skill, Veterinary Healing, allows similar treatment of animals and monsters.)
This skill cannot be used on a wounded character more than once for the same set of wounds.
If the character receives new wounds, Healing
skill can be applied against the new wounds. The
skill is rolled against a set of wounds, not individually against each injury. (The term "set of
wounds" usually refers to all the hit points lost
by a character in a single combat situation.)
If a healer rolls a natural 20 when using this
skill, he accidentally inflicts 1d3 points of damage to the patient, and he may not treat that set
of wounds again.
Successful skill rolls allow the healer to diagnose type of illness. In addition, a roll made by 5
or more will allow the character to determine
whether an illness is natural or magically induced.
Hunting: This is the ability to locate, stalk,
and hunt large and small game with the bow,
sling, or spear. Successful use of this skill gives
the character a +1 to hit with a bow, sling, or
spear against an unaware target in a peaceful
outdoor setting; the skill is not usable in most
combat situations.
The character can automatically supply himself with food over a long period of time if he is
in a fairly fertile area and has a missile weapon,
spear, or javelin. In areas not normally rich in
game he must make a skill roll and receive penalties to that roll (penalties determined by the
DM). If he is trying to supply more than just
himself, he must make a skill roll if he is supplying one other person, and he takes a - 1 penalty
for each additional person after the first he is trying to supply. He must roll each day, and failure
indicates that he has not found enough food to
feed everyone that day.
A character with the Hunting skill forages automatically in fertile areas (even when on the
move) and uses his Hunting skill roll to determine how successful he is during full days spent
in search of game.
Intimidation: This is the ability to bully nonplayer characters into doing what the player
character wants them to do. Success means that
NPCs are intimidated into doing what the character wants. This skill cannot be used against
PCs. NPCs who have this skill used upon them
are unlikely to ever become friends with the intimidating player character.
Use of this skill means that the character is either implicitly or explicitly threatening the target with violence or other dire consequences if
the target doesn't comply. For this reason, Intimidation works best against low-level characters. It does not work at all on player characters
or on NPCs of 5th level or higher. The DM can
also, at his or her option, decide that it does not
work on someone who is obviously in a much
stronger position than the character using the
skill. For example, a king surrounded by elite
guards, even if he himself is a 1st level character,
is unlikely to feel threatened.
Knowledge (choose type): The character is an
expert in one field of study such as the culture or
geography of an area, history, legends, theology,
etc. A character can usually make his living by
teaching his skill or acting as an expert on the
subject; with a successful roll, he can make expert commentary on information relating to his
skill. The character taking this skill must specify
what sort of knowledge he is acquiring. A character can select multiple Knowledge skills, using
one for each different field of study.
Labor: The character is very accomplished at
one type of labor such as bricklaying, farming,
mining, stonecutting, etc. The character can
make his living with the skill. With a successful
roll, he can interpret information in light of his
occupation. A character must specify which type
of labor he knows, and he can select multiple Labor skills to be proficient in many types of jobs.
Language (choose type): See "Optional Rule
for Languages," later in this chapter.
Law and Justice: This is the knowledge of the
laws and judicial system of one culture or country; characters who wish to be a judge or advocate (lawyer) must select this skill. Each empire
or nation has its own codes, so characters who
wish to be conversant in different nations' codes
should choose this skill for each set of laws they
wish to study.
Leadership: Successful use of this skill adds
+ 1 to the morale of any NPCs under the character's control. It can also be used to convince other
NPCs to follow the character's commands. The
DM can decide that any NPC who has a good
reason nor to follow the leader is automatically
successful at resisting this skill. Unlike Intimidation, Leadership does not bully, antagonize, or
make enemies of the NPCs it is used upon.
Lip Reading: To use this skill, the character
must be able to see the lips of the target person
or creature and understand the language being
spoken. A successful check allows a character to
"overhear" the conversation; if the lip reader
understands the language being spoken, he can
understand the speakers' words. The distance to
the target and the available light should be taken into account—the DM should apply skill roll
penalties for difficult situations.
Magical Engineering: This is the ability to recognize the basic principles of some unfamiliar
magical devices. It does not include practical
training in design or fabrication of magical artifacts. It does allow the character to recognize
most common magical items with a successful
skill roll. It doesn't allow a character to recognize
uncommon magical items or to distinguish
trapped or cursed items from safe ones.
Mapping (Cartography): If a character has this
skill, he can understand and make maps even if
he cannot read and write. The skill allows the
character to comprehend simple maps without a
skill roll; the character should make skill rolls to
interpret or draft complicated layouts or to map
an area by memory. A character does not have to
have this skill in order to map a dungeon as the
characters explore it. A character who can map
but not read obviously cannot understand the
words on a map.
Military Tactics: This skill allows a character to
interpret the movement of enemy forces and to
move his own forces better. When using this
skill, the player (not the character) first examines
the situation and decides what he thinks is
right—what he thinks the enemy is doing or how
he should set up his units.
The DM, not the player, rolls the character's
Military Tactics skill. On a successful roll, the
DM will truthfully tell the player whether he has
calculated correctly; if he has not calculated correctly but the roll was successful, the DM should
offer some advice on how the player should set
up his forces. If the roll is a failure, the DM
should tell the player his character cannot interpret the enemy troop movements well enough to
use them to his advantage. The success of the roll
determines bonuses or penalties for the troops
during mass combat.
Mimicry: This is the ability to mimic animal
noises and foreign-language accents. This is a
very useful skill in the wilderness especially.
When characters use recognition codes or signals
that imitate the screech of a hoot owl or a noise
from some other animal, this skill allows them to
mimic those noises convincingly so that enemy
listeners are not automatically tipped off that
there are spies in the area.
Mountaineering: This does not replace a
thief's special climbing ability; it is the skill of
mountain-climbing with the use of ropes, pitons, and other climbing gear. A character who
has Mountaineering skill can use such gear to
climb difficult mountain and cliff faces and can
rig lines to enable nonclimbers to tackle those
faces as well.
Muscle: This skill is experience with heavy lifting and hard labor. The character can direct
groups of laborers so that their efforts are the
most effective possible. This character understands the use of simple machinery such as
wedges, pulleys, and levers. With a successful
skill check, the character receives a + 2 bonus on
Strength rolls for tasks such as opening doors.
Music (choose type): This skill allows a character to play one group of related instruments in a
skilled manner. The player chooses the group of
instruments that his character knows, and the
character can take the skill several times in order
to know multiple instrument groups. Groups include stringed instruments, brass, percussion,
woodwinds, etc. This skill is often taken in conjunction with the Singing skill.
Mysticism: This skill, though similar to Ceremony (above), is taken by nonclerics. This skill
allows the character to instinctively know the
best course of action to please the Immortals in
general. A successful skill roll, for example,
means that the character recognizes an idol dedicated to an Immortal and that the characters
should give it its due respects.
Nature Lore: This skill is the knowledge of
common plant and animal life forms of one specific terrain: desert, forest, jungle, mountain/
hill, open sea, plains, or arctic. The character can
gain several Nature Lore skills by spending one
skill slot for each different terrain he learns.
This skill gives the character knowledge of
such things as edible and poisonous plants, healing herbs, and signs of unnatural danger (such as
unusual quiet, absence of normal plant or animal life, atypical animal behavior, etc.).
When the character uses this skill in his home
territory, he receives a - 2 bonus to the die rolled
for the skill check. When he uses it in territory
very similar to his home, he receives no bonus.
The less it resembles his own home territory, the
greater the penalty he will receive, up to a +4.
Navigation: By taking directions from the position of the sun and the stars (or of whatever atmospheric phenomena are appropriate in your
campaign), the character can always know
roughly where he is. Successful skill rolls, with
positive or negative modifiers for the character's
distance from his home territory and familiarity
with his surroundings, will tell the character
more precisely where he is.
Persuasion: This is the ability to persuade
NPCs of your character's honesty and sincerity.
This isn't a liar's skill; the speaker must believe
the truth of what he says. Successful use of the
skill means the listener believes what the speaker
tells him. It does not mean that the listener will
agree to actions proposed by the speaker. The
DM can assign modifiers from + 1 to + 8 to the
skill roll if the audience is hostile. This is a good
skill for diplomats and negotiators to have.
Piloting (choose type): This is the equivalent
of the Riding skill but applies to sailing vessels.
(It can also apply to large flying vessels such as
aerial ships and flying castles, if such things are
present in a campaign. The use of magical items
such as flying carpets and flying brooms does not
require the Piloting skill.) A character must use a
different category of Piloting for each different
type of vessel, as defined in the Piloting Skill:
Types of Vessels Table. As such, he will need to
spend more than one skill to pilot more than one
type of vessel.
Piloting Skill: Types of Vessels Table

Water vessels
Flying vessels
Vessels in This Category
River boat, sailing boat, canoe, ship's lifeboat, raft

Planar Geography: This skill gives the character a general knowledge of the Prime, inner, outer, Astral, and Ethereal Planes as described
elsewhere in this book. This skill includes knowledge of techniques of travel among the planes
and common inhabitants of known planes.
Profession: The character is accomplished at
one type of nonlabor profession such as politics,
cooking, estate management, horse grooming,
scribing (the character must be literate), etc. The
character can make his living with his skill, and
(with a successful roll) make expert commentary
on subjects pertaining to his skill. The player
must indicate which specific profession his character knows; a character can buy several different
Profession skills.
Quick Draw: A successful skill check with this
skill allows the character to nock and fire an arrow with a + 2 bonus to individual initiative.
Riding (choose type): This skill includes the
basic care and feeding of a riding animal and the
ability to control it under difficult circumstances. Riding rolls are required if a character is trying to use a weapon from the back of a riding
animal; failure means that the mount is moving
too much for the character to use the weapon.
Each Riding skill allows the character to ride
one type of animal; if a character wishes to know
how to ride two different types of beasts, he
must buy two different Riding skills. Horses constitute one type of animal; giant eagles constitute another.
When a character uses his Riding skill on the
wrong animal (for example, when a horse rider
tries to ride a camel), he suffers a +4 to his Riding rolls. When a character with no Riding skill
at all tries to ride an animal, he must make a
Dexterity check at a +8 penalty to his die roll.
However, a character doesn't have to make the
success roll except in difficult situations, such as
when the animal is spooked. Otherwise, he can
stay on the animal's back without difficulty.
Science (choose type): The character is an expert in one branch of scientific study such as astronomy, geology, metallurgy, etc. Characters
with this skill can make their living with it, usually as specialists in large cities. The DM should
not allow this skill to characters belonging to
more primitive cultures, but it is entirely appropriate to characters from highly civilized areas of
the world. The player must indicate which
branch of science his character has mastered; a
character can buy multiple Science skills to know
multiple disciplines.
Shipbuilding: This is the skill of designing
and building ships. It allows a character to supervise the construction of professional-quality
ships, whether they are made by muscle or by
magic. The Shipbuilding skill will also let characters evaluate the ships they encounter, determine who built them and when, etc.
Signaling (choose type): Successful use of this
skill allows the character to leave messages that
can only be understood by another Signaling
specialist of the same culture, trade guild, military force, or "school." For instance, one dwarf
character with the Signaling skill could pile rocks
into a cluster; it would communicate nothing to
most characters, but another dwarf character
with Signaling would recognize it as a signal and
be able to interpret its meaning.
When a character takes a Signaling skill, he
must specify the type and culture of signals that
he will be studying and he must have the opportunity to learn such signals. Appropriate types of
signals include military trumpet signals, naval
flag signals, smoke signals, drum signals, etc.
Singing: This is the ability to sing in a skilled
manner; a character can make his living with this
skill and (if he is good enough) can become a famous entertainer or bard.
Snares: This is the skill of building traps to
capture animals, monsters, and unwanted visitors. A successful skill roll means the trap functions properly. The DM can assign modifiers to
the skill roll based on the mount of time the
character had to set up the trap, the availability
of materials, etc.
Stealth (choose terrain): This is similar to the
thief's Move Silently ability, with some important differences. The character taking the Stealth
skill must choose one type of terrain in which the
skill works from the following list: city/
outdoors, indoors/caves, forest/jungle, plains,
desert, arctic, and mountains/hills. The skill only works in that type of terrain. (However, the
character could conceivably spend seven slots,
one for each type of Stealth skill.)
City/Outdoors is used in the streets, in trashstrewn alleyways, on rooftops, and in similar urban environments. Indoors/Caves is used in
dungeons and catacombs, in caverns and caves,
and in most enclosed spaces. The other terrain
types are self-explanatory.
Humans, demihumans, and humanoids can
take the Stealth skill. The character will move
very quietly in the terrains for which he has the
skill. When he is trying to sneak up on someone
or when there is a chance that he will be heard,
he must make his skill check. If the DM doesn't
want him to know that the DM can make the
skill check for him.
Storytelling: This is the ability to captivate an
audience when telling stories. The character can
earn his living as a teller of stories; if he also has
Knowledge skills of such things as history, he can
be a storyteller of history.
Survival (choose terrain): This skill allows the
character to easily find food (especially vegetables and fruits), shelter, and water in a single
type of terrain, selected from one of the following: desert, forest/jungle, mountain/hill, open
sea, plains, arctic. Desert Survival doesn't give
the character the ability to survive in the forest;
he must also take Forest Survival for that.
A character with the Survival skill forages automatically in fertile areas, even when on the
move. If he is trying to supply more than just
himself, he must make a skill check at a + 1 penalty to his die roll for each additional person that
he is trying to supply. He must roll each day, and
failure indicates that he has not found enough
food for everyone he is trying to supply.
Tracking: The character can follow tracks. The
DM is free to increase or penalize the chance of
success depending on the circumstances (age of
the tracks, type of terrain, number of tracks being followed, and so forth).
Veterinary Healing: This is the same as Healing (above), but this skill pertains to creatures
that are neither humans nor demihumans—in
other words, nonhumans, monsters, normal animals, and so forth.
A character can take this skill in one of two
ways: 1) as a General Veterinary Healing skill,
which means that he makes his roll with a + 1
penalty for every type of creature he treats; or 2)
as a Specialized Veterinary Healing skill that pertains to one class of creatures (for example,
equines). The character with a Specialized Veterinary Healing skill takes no penalty when treating the creatures that are his specialty, but he
takes a + 2 penalty with all other types of creatures. (A character could take the skill twice, one
General and one Specialized; he would have his
listed roll for the creatures that were his specialty
and only have a + 1 penalty when treating all
other creatures.) A character with Veterinary
Healing skill trying to treat a human or demihuman rolls at a + 3 penalty.
Wrestling: In wrestling combat, a successful
roll will give the character a + 1 to his wrestling
rating (see the "Unarmed Combat" rules in
Chapter 8). Higher skill scores give higher bonuses, so a character with Wrestling +1 would
receive a + 2 bonus, and so on.
Optional Rule for Languages
With the DM's permission, characters can use
skill slots to take additional languages. (Additional languages are an Intelligence-based skill.)
For each slot spent on a new language, the character can speak the language (not necessarily very
well) and can read it (if he is intelligent enough
to read his regular languages). Characters still
get all the free languages they're entitled to from
their Intelligence and racial abilities.
Characters have trouble speaking these additional "skill languages." A character speaking a
skill language will automatically understand
someone speaking slowly and simply. If the character is listening to someone who is excited or using technical speech, he must make his skill roll
to understand the language. Failure means he
didn't understand what was said.
The character speaking a skill language communicates in the same way. When he's struggling to explain something fast, complicated, or
technical or when he's flustered or excited, he
must make a skill roll to get the idea across.
Improving Skills
Characters' skills can be increased to higher
scores. Simply use more skill choices to improve
skill rolls, and the PC will get a +1 to his skill roll
for every skill choice added to that skill. A skill
choice can be used to either improve an existing
skill by one point or to buy a new skill, not both.
Example: Alaric has only a Charisma of 12, yet
he wants to be a natural leader. Instead of using
only one skill choice to purchase the Leadership
skill, he chooses to use three on that skill. The
first choice gives him his Leadership skill; he
must roll his Charisma score, 12, for all Leadership checks. His two extra skill choices give him
an additional + 2 to his rolls (+1 for each skill
choice spent). His Leadership checks will now be
made at 14 instead of 12.
Learning More Skills
Your character can choose to purchase more
skills or improve existing ones. All characters get
a new skill slot every four experience levels.
Thus, humans get four slots (plus bonuses for
high Intelligence) at level 1, then an extra at
level 5, another at level 9, another at level 13,
and so on. See the Skill Slot Acquisition (Humans) Table.
Above 12th level, dwarves get another skill
slot at 1,200,000 experience points and another
slot for every 800,000 experience earned after
that. Above 10th level, elves get another slot at
1,350,000 experience points and another for
every 1,000,000 experience points earned after
that. Above 8th level, halflings get another slot
at 300,000 experience points and another for
every 1,200,000 points earned beyond that.
These points are outlined in the Skill Slot Acquisition (Demihumans) Table.
The DM can simply assume that your character is meeting with a teacher who can instruct
him in the skill, or the DM can introduce an
NPC who is the character's teacher. Unlike the
situation with weapon mastery, the character
never has to roll anything to acquire the skill. If
the DM says the skill is available to player characters and if the PC has an empty skill slot and access to a teacher, he can take the skill.
Important DM's Note: Intelligent monsters,
such as orcs and giants, can also have general
skills. The DM may prefer only to give skills to
monsters that have distinctive personalities and
roles within a campaign.
Skills and the DM
It's the responsibility of the DM to see to it
that players don't abuse these skills and achieve
results totally inappropriate to their use in the
campaign. It's also the responsibility of the DM
to reward characters who use their skills cleverly
and in the context of the adventure.
The DM decides when a character can try his
skill roll, and the DM also decides what sort of
effect the skill can have in a situation. The DM
shouldn't make the characters roll over and over
for the same task, only at critical points in play.
Positive and Negative Modifiers
When the character is using a skill, the DM
may wish to assign positive or negative modifiers
to make the character's roll easier or harder.
These modifiers are based on circumstances.
Circumstances that make a job slightly more
difficult warrant a +1 or +2 modifier. Those
that make the job substantially more difficult
warrant a +3 or +4 modifier. Those that make
the job very hard—such as not being able to see,
working on the rolling deck of a ship during a
severe storm, and so forth—can warrant penalties of +5, + 10, or even + 15 to the roll.
On the other hand, circumstances that make
the job easier—such as having all the materials
needed, having lots of time, and so forth—
warrant positive benefits a: the same scale.
The character always has a chance of success,
however bad the odds, as long as the DM says it's
remotely possible to succeed. A natural roll of 1
on ld20 is an automatic success, just as a roll of
20 is an automatic failure.
Time Use
When it's important to know, the DM decides
how much time each use of a skill represents.
The time it takes to look at the stars and make a
basic Navigation roll might be about a minute;
the time it takes to make a superior spear, both
head and shaft, will be a few days; and the time
it takes to make a Tracking roll to recognize what
sort of creature left the prints before a character
may only be a second or two.
Using Skills Together
Often, when the character's skill roll has
failed, all the other characters with the same skill
will say, "He failed?! Let me make my skill roll!"
This isn't a good thing to do. If the DM lets
everyone make a skill roll for the same task when
someone has failed, one character will eventually
succeed; it's therefore pointless to have a skills
system since every task will be "automatically"
(that is, "eventually") successful.
The DM should usually decide that the circumstances that led one character to fail will
make all the others fail. For example, a character
tracking his prey fails his roll and loses the track.
The DM decides that it's because the creature
went to the trees, a rainfall obliterated the
tracks, or whatever, there are no tracks to find.
Therefore, the other characters can't make their
own Tracking skill rolls here, except to confirm
the fact that there are no tracks.
However, sometimes it's reasonable for characters to use their skills together to solve a task.
For example, when two healers are trying to diagnose a disease, two can be better than one.
The characters can choose which of them is the
chief problem-solver for this situation (usually
the PC with the highest skill), and that PC and
the others with the same skill all make their skill
rolls. The DM uses the roll of the chief problemsolver and gives him a - 1 modifier for every one
of his friends who made the roll and a + 1 modifier for every one who failed it. The chief
problem-solver can never receive more than a
- 3 bonus this way, but there is no limit to the
penalty he can receive if his allies all roll badly.
Using Skills Against Each Other
Sometimes situations will come up where two
skills are in conflict. A character with Deception
can try to fast-talk a character with Detect Deception, or two Bargaining characters can haggle. When the DM sees this situation occur, he
can have both parties roll their appropriate skills.
The character with the lowest successful roll wins
the contest. When a tied roll occurs, the DM has
to analyze the situation; he may have them reroll
for a clear decision or he may decide that the situation is unchanged.

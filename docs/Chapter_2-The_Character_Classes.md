ine character professions, or "character
classes," are described below. They include
the Your basic human classes (cleric, fighter,
magic-user, thief), the three demihuman classes
(dwarf, elf, halfling), and two special human
classes (druid, mystic).
Each character class is presented in the following fashion.
Boxed Material: This box shows abbreviated
information about the character class for players
who are already familiar with the game and only
need to be reminded of certain details.
Description: The class is described in terms of
the traits, goals, and abilities common to all
members of the profession or race.
Experience Table: This table shows the maximum experience level a member of this character
class can attain, the number of experience points
it takes to achieve each experience level, and the
number of magical spells the character acquires
at each level (in the case of spellcasting character
classes).
Saving Throws Table: This table shows the
character's saving throws at every experience
level the character can attain.
Class Details: This text talks about many of
the class' special characteristics: its prime requisite, its Hit Dice, restrictions or advantages with
armor and weapons, and any other significant
details.
Special Abilities: This text talks about any
special abilities which the character class possesses. Some classes can cast magical spells; some can
see in the dark; some have no special abilities at
all. Some special abilities will require tables and
tables of their own.
At Higher Experience Levels: Finally, this text
describes special characteristics and responsibilities the character acquires when he reaches higher levels of experience.
Understanding the
Tables
Take a look at any of the experience tables in
the following pages. Here's an explanation of
those tables' column headings.
Level: This column shows the experience
levels which characters of this class can attain.
Most human classes can reach 36th level; some
classes are more restricted.
XP: This column shows the number of experience points it takes for the character to attain
each experience level. A starting character has 0
experience points and is at 1st level.
Attack Rank: Not all experience tables will
have this column; only the demihuman tables
have it. Attack ranks are measures of a demihuman's ability to improve his fighting skills
even when he's reached his maximum experience level. Each attack rank corresponds to a
fighter's experience level when you determine
how well the demihuman hits in combat; see the
Attack Rolls Table on page 106 to see how well
demihumans attack at different attack ranks.
Spells/Level: Not all experience tables will
have this column—only the tables belonging to
spellcasting character classes. As you'll see in
Chapter 3, spells are arranged in levels—just as
there are 1st level characters, there are 1st level
spells, for instance. The table shows how many
spells of which spell level a character can know.
About the Classes
Here are some notes on the three categories of
character classes—humans, demihumans, and
special—before you progress on to the actual
class descriptions.
Human Classes
In the D&D® game, humans are the most prolific race. They are also the race with the greatest
potential. While demihuman character classes
can only attain moderate experience levels (8th,
10th, or 12th level, depending on the class/
race), each of the four basic human character
classes can attain 36th experience level.
In many D&D game campaigns, human civilization is similar to the civilizations of Western
Europe in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance period. In such campaigns, you can expect
to see most humans living in kingdoms ruled by
a king and queen and organized in feudal fiefdoms, with a rising middle class of traders and
craftsmen in the cities.
However, your Dungeon Master may decide
not to follow that standard; he may prefer for his
human civilizations to resemble ancient Egypt,
feudal Japan, conquistador-era Mexico, a culture
from a specific fantasy novel, or something created from his own imagination. Be sure to ask
your Dungeon Master about the nature of human cultures in his world; the more you know
ahead of time, the better you can fit your character into the existing setting.
Demihuman Classes
Demihuman characters are more limited than
human characters. They can't rise to very high
levels of experience (dwarves are limited to 12th
level, elves to 10th, halflings to 8th). Elves cannot learn very powerful magic; they can only
learn up to 5th level spells, while humans can
learn up to 9th level spells.
Clans: The demihuman race of dwarves, elves,
and halflings have a different way of life than
humans. They usually live longer, have a stricter
way of life, and find security in large family
groups called Clans. A Clan may include several
hundred demihumans. The head of the Clan is
always the oldest member, male or female, assuming that member is fit to rule.
Day-to-day tasks are usually done by those
best suited to do them. Unlike many human
communities, few demihumans are lazy; everyone has a job, with Clan duties and responsibilities, and "goofing off is nearly unthinkable.
The DM may choose to develop many other aspects of demihuman family life (such as marriage customs, industry, clan-to-clan relations,
and so forth) as needed.
Demihuman Relations: Elves and dwarves
don't usually like each other. This dislike usually
surfaces as verbal battles, rather than physical.
Both get along fairly well with halflings.
The DM will decide why elves and dwarves
don't get along in his own campaign. In the
D&D game's Known World setting, it's because
they are so physically and emotionally different
(elves are tall and willowy, dwarves short and
stocky; elves love freedom and the outdoors,
dwarves love organization and caverns, etc.),
and because the two races had many clashes in
the past for which they've never forgiven one another. But the reason can be different in your
own campaign; a DM can decide, for instance,
that in his own world the elves and dwarves are
the best of friends!
All demihuman races trade and interact with
humans; though men can be dangerous, many
are also trustworthy and have good points.
Special Abilities and Maneuvers: All demihuman races receive special abilities, which
make them much more effective than humans in
certain situations. The special abilities of each
race are detailed in the description of each character class.
Special Classes
There are two other human character classes,
the druid and the mystic, which are described
separately from the cleric, fighter, magic-user,
and thief. We present them separately because
the DM may not wish to include them in his
campaign.
The druid is a little complicated, because
druid characters start play as clerics and then
change their character classes to become druids.
The mystic, a monastic specialist in unarmed
combat, is not appropriate for all campaigns.
Some of their special abilities mimic those of
other human classes, but many are unique to
this class, including their increasingly powerful
unarmed combat tactics.
Cleric
Prime Requisite: Wisdom.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Wisdom 13-15,
10% for Wisdom 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d6 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, +1 hit point per
level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.
Maximum Level: 36.
Armor: Any, plus shield.
Weapons: No edged or pointed weapons;
all others permitted.
Special Abilities: Turning undead; clerical
spells.
A cleric is a human character who is dedicated
to serving a great and worthy cause. This cause
can be an Immortal being dedicated to a specific
goal or attribute; sometimes the cleric is serving
only his alignment, and has no interest in immortal beings. The D&D game does not deal
with the ethical and theological beliefs of the
characters in the game.
All clerics belong to orders, or clerical societies, made up of clerics serving the same ends.
A brand-new cleric character is at the very bottom of his clerical organization; as he gains experience levels, he will also gain new powers and
responsibilities pertaining to his clerical order.
The DM will decide, and will inform you, how
the clerical orders of his campaign are arranged.
A cleric can learn to cast spells after gaining a
level of experience. A 1st level cleric cannot cast
any spells; once he reaches 2nd level, he can begin to cast spells. A cleric's spell powers come
from the strength of the cleric's beliefs. The cleric sits and meditates, and magically learns spells.
These spells can then be used during an adventure. Most clerical spells are for healing, protec-

tion, and gathering information Clerical spells
are different from magic-user spells. Clerics can
use only their own type of spells; they never utilize magic-user spells.
Clerics have good fighting skills and can fight
monsters. A cleric can wear any type of armor,
like a fighter; he can use many types of weapons,
but cannot use edged or piercing weapons of any
sort. Unlike magic-users, whose spells are often
used during battles, a cleric's spells are usually
needed after battles (such as cures) or for general
exploring (such as detecting things).
If your party has enough fighters, your cleric
should not need to fight often. But he is
equipped for fighting if his combat skill is needed. Watch for ways that his spells can help before, during, and after battles.
For the first three levels of experience, a cleric's power is very limited. But as they advance (to
a maximum of 36th level), clerics obtain more
spells of greater power, due both to practice and
the strengthening of their beliefs.
It is very important for clerics to be faithful to
their beliefs. If a cleric behaves in a manner that
is not consistent with the character's alignment
or beliefs, the cleric may be punished by the
order—or by even greater powers. This punishment could be a penalty on attack rolls, a dangerous quest that must be completed, or even a
lack of spells. The DM will tell you what the
character must do to regain his good standing.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A cleric's prime requisite is
Wisdom. If a cleric has a Wisdom score of 13-15,
the character gains a 5% bonus to experience
points earned in every adventure; if his Wisdom
is 16-18, he earns a 10% bonus to XP.
Hit Dice: Roll a six-sided die (1d6) to determine a cleric's hit points. A cleric starts with 1d6
(1-6) hit points (plus any Constitution bonus)
and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with
each level of experience. One additional hit
point is gained for each level after 9th level.
Armor: A cleric can wear any kind of armor,
and can use a shield.
Weapons: A cleric cannot use any weapon
with a sharp edge or point; this is forbidden by
the cleric's beliefs. This includes arrows and
quarrels. But the cleric can use any non-edged
weapon.
Special Abilities
A cleric has two special abilities: turning undead monsters and casting clerical spells.
Turning Undead
A cleric has the power to force certain monsters called the "undead" (skeletons, zombies,
ghouls, wights, and other types) to run away, or
even to perish. This special ability is called
"turning undead."
When a cleric encounters an undead monster,
the cleric may either attack it normally (with a
weapon or spell), or try to turn it. The cleric cannot both attack and turn undead in one round.
When you want your cleric to try to turn undead, just tell your Dungeon Master "I'll try to
turn undead this round." The power to turn undead is inherent in the cleric; he does not need
the symbol of his faith or any other device to do
it, unless the DM declares otherwise.
Undead monsters are not automatically turned by the cleric. When the encounter occurs, the
player must refer to the cleric's Turning Undead
table to find the effect the cleric has.
When the cleric tries to turn an undead monster, find the cleric's level of experience across
the top of the table. Read down the left column
until you find the name of the undead monster.
If you see a "—"in the column, then you cannot turn the monster. If you see anything else,
you have a chance to turn the monster, or perhaps several monsters. See immediately below,
under "Explanation of Results," to learn how to
find out if you have turned the monster.
Apply the results immediately. If the attempt
succeeds, one or more of the undead monsters
will retreat or be destroyed. But don't forget, if
the monster is turned, it hasn't been destroyed;
it may decide to return soon. . . .
If you try to turn a specific undead monster
(for instance, one specific vampire) and fail, you
cannot try again to turn it in the same fight. At
some later encounter, you can try to turn that individual again.
Explanation of Results
7, 9, or 11: Whenever a number is listed, the
cleric has a chance to turn the undead monsters.
The player rolls 2d6 (two six-sided dice). If the
total is equal to or greater than the number
given, the attempt at turning undead is successful.
When the attempt at turning undead is successful, the Dungeon Master (not the player) will
roll 2d6 to determine the number of Hit Dice of
undead monsters that turn away. At least one
monster will be turned, regardless of what the
DM rolls on his dice.
Example: A 1st level cleric has just encountered a group of seven zombies. Zombies (as you

can learn in Chapter 14) each have two Hit Dice
(2 HD). The cleric tries to turn the zombies.
On the Turning Undead Table, a 1st level cleric vs. a zombie yields a result of 9: The cleric
must roll a 9 or greater on 2d6 to turn the zombies. The cleric's player rolls 2d6 and achieves a
10—he has successfully turned undead.
The DM now rolls to see what sort of results
the cleric achieves. He rolls 2d6 and achieves an
8; in other words, the cleric turns 8 Hit Dice of
zombies. Since each zombie is a 2-Hit Die creature, the cleric has turned four zombies. Four
zombies turn and begin shambling away from
the cleric as fast as they can move. This leaves the
cleric with only three to fight. Next round, he
can attack them with weapons or spells, or he can
try to turn them, too.
T: The attempt at turning the undead automatically succeeds; the cleric's player does not
need to roll for success. To determine how many
undead will be turned, the DM rolls 2d6 as described above; regardless of his roll, at least one
undead will be turned.
D: The attempt at turning the undead automatically succeeds—in fact, it succeeds so well
that the affected monsters are destroyed instead
of merely turned. To determine how many Hit
Dice of undead will be destroyed, the DM rolls
2d6 as described above; regardless of his roll, at
least one undead will be destroyed. (The DM decides what happens when the monsters are destroyed: They might fade away, burst into flame
and crumble away, or disintegrate like a vampire
in sunlight, for instance.)
D +: This is the same as the "D" result above,
except that the DM rolls 3d6 to find out how
many Hit Dice of undead will be destroyed. Regardless of the roll, at least one undead will be
destroyed.
D#: This is the same as the "D" result above,
except that the DM rolls 4d6 to find out how
many Hit Dice of undead will be destroyed. Regardless of the roll, at least one undead will be
destroyed.
Using Clerical Spells
Starting at the 2nd level of experience (having
earned 1,500 XP or more), the cleric can use
spells. The procedures by which the cleric learns
and casts his spells are described in Chapter 3.
Higher Experience Levels
When a cleric reaches Name level (9th), he is
called a patriarch (if male) or matriarch (if female). At this point in his adventuring career, he
has several options available to him.
If the character is a Neutral cleric, he can decide to become a druid instead (see the description of that character class below); he certainly
does not have to change his class.
If the cleric is a Neutral who does not want to
become a druid, or if he is Lawful or Chaotic
alignment, he must decide whether to build a
clerical stronghold approved by his clerical order.
Depending on how the DM has set up his
campaign, the cleric might have built himself a

home, even a lavish castle, long before. However, that was his personal home, regardless of
how big it is or what he has done with it. Here,
we're talking about a stronghold sanctioned by
the cleric's order, one which will be built and
maintained to further the goals of the order.
Land-Owning Clerics
A cleric who decides to build a stronghold
with the sanction of his clerical order is called a
"land-owning cleric." (Note: This is merely a
convenient term. A land-owning cleric can go
adventuring with his footloose friends; he is not
tied to his land.) There are advantages and disadvantages to setting up a clerical stronghold.
Advantages: The character can progress up
through the ranks of his clerical order. The character may receive financial aid from his order toward
the building of the stronghold. The character may
be able to increase his lands and build strong
settlements there, which could result in him becoming a very wealthy character indeed.
Disadvantages: The character will be the chief
clerical authority (for his clerical order) for the
lands around his stronghold. This means that he
has clerical responsibilities to all the people living on and around his lands—responsibilities
which may interfere with his desire to travel with
his old adventuring friends or which may confront him with difficult problems.
Traveling Clerics
A cleric who decides not to build a stronghold
sanctioned by his order is referred to as a "traveling cleric," even if he is not always on the road
traveling. There are also advantages and disadvantages to being a traveling cleric.
Advantages: The cleric does not have to tie
himself down to any one place or group of people; except when acting on official requests from
his order, he may go where he pleases.
Disadvantages: The cleric may not rise to or
above the rank of a land-owning cleric, and may
not achieve much political influence within his
order. (He doesn't stop earning experience
points, experience levels, or personal power; he
just cannot climb any higher in the clerical order's hierarchy.) The cleric still has responsibilities to his clerical order, naturally; as before, he
may be required at any time to uphold the beliefs and accomplish the goals of his order.
Becoming a Land Owner
If the 9th level cleric decides to build a stronghold, he must report to a superior of some type,
either an official of his order or a ruler of the nation where he wishes to settle, to ask for land. This ruler should willingly grant the land, unless
the cleric has had problems with him in the past;
if so, the ruler may require some service of the
cleric (such as a quest) before he grants the land.
(The DM must decide whether the cleric's order
has the power to make such grants, according to
the civilization of his campaign world.)
If the cleric has never been punished for misbehavior, either by his order or by the powers
that grant him his spells, his order can (at the DM's discretion) help him with the cost of building the stronghold. Such help usually involves
the order paying for up to any amount the DM
feels to be reasonable (the standard is 50% of
the stronghold's construction). The player
should design the stronghold the way he wishes
to see it built. The DM will calculate how much
it would cost to build, determine to his own satisfaction how much of the design is good and
necessary planning (and how much is extravagant overexpenditure), and decide what proportion of the cost the clerical order will assume.
Regardless of how much the clerical order
pays, the stronghold is technically the cleric's
property. The cleric can't deny access to the
property and its facilities to members of his
order—normally, he shouldn't ever wish to do
so—but it's his land, and he can't just be assigned to some other stronghold against his will.
A number (typically 1d6) of lower level clerics
will come to the stronghold once it is built, to assist and serve the cleric in operating the stronghold's clerical functions. (See Chapter 11 for more
on this.) Naturally, he'll get fewer or no assistant
clerics if he has a reputation for abusing or endangering his retainers. These clerics have arrived
with the intention of helping to operate the
stronghold, not to travel with the cleric on his adventures. The DM should create each of these
clerics as an individual, with his own name, personality, background, goals, and abilities.
If the cleric manages his land well and serves
his order equally well, he will probably rise in
power in the bureaucracy of his clerical order. In
addition, he may be awarded more land; more
normal men will settle the area around the cleric's stronghold, and the cleric will receive more
tax income from the settlements.
Choosing to Travel
A cleric who decides to travel may follow one
of two routes: in civilized lands, or in wilderness.
A cleric who travels within the boundaries of
the civilized world usually looks for ways to help
those of the same alignment (whatever that may
be). The cleric may travel alone, with retainers,
or with other clerics.
A cleric who travels to the wilderness usually
searches for enemies of the clerical order, to convert or destroy. This cleric normally travels with
other characters as an adventuring party (though
the others may all be NPCs).
Changing Back and Forth
Once a player decides to be a traveling or
land-owning cleric, only a major development in
the campaign or in the character should change
that status. The DM should discourage frequent
or casual changes of the cleric's status.
Fighter
Prime Requisite: Strength.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15,
10% for Strength 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d8 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, +2 hit points per
level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.
Maximum Level: 36th.
Armor: Any; shields allowed.
Weapons: Any.
Special Abilities: Lance Attack and Set
Spear vs. Charge maneuvers, Fighter Combat
Options (see Chapter 8).
A fighter is a human whose main ability is
fighting skill. Fighters often have greater
Strength than other characters. They usually hit
opponents more often in combat, and inflict
more damage.
In the D&D® game, fighters protect their
weaker friends and allies. A party made up only
of fighters would probably survive most
dungeon and wilderness encounters, even those
where magic would be useful. Every group of explorers should have at least one or two fighters.
In group adventures, the fighters should stay
in front and act as the "front line" in combat
situations. If there are three or more fighters in
the party, one should stay in the back, in case the
characters' party is approached from the rear by
enemies. In battle itself, fighters have a better
chance at surviving physical damage, since they
have more hit points than most other classes.
A fighter character should be able to use a variety of weapons. Unless your conception of your
fighter character limits him to one class of weapons, you should equip him with both hand-tohand and missile weapons.
Fighters may advance as high as 36th level.
Their rapid advances, both in combat ability and
in their amount of hit points, make them natural
leaders in human settlements, especially small
ones. High level fighters spend a lot of their time
training and leading men-at-arms, clearing the
wilderness of monsters, and expanding human
settlements.

Class Details
Prime Requisite: A fighter's prime requisite is
Strength. If a fighter has a Strength score of 13-
15 or more, the character gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if
his Strength is 16-18, his bonus is 10%.
Hit Dice: Roll an 8-sided die (1d8) to determine a fighter's hit points. A fighter starts with
1d8 (1-8) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if
any) and gains 1d8 more hit points (plus bonus)
with each level of experience. Two additional hit
points are gained for each level after 9th level.
Armor: A fighter can wear any kind of armor
and may use a shield.
Weapons: A fighter can use any kind of weapon.
Special Abilities
Beginning fighters initially receive only a couple of special abilities and need no other special
abilities to survive and prosper. Their great
strength, hit points, strong armor, and many
weapons make them a powerful character class
without additional special abilities. At higher
experience levels, though, they do receive some
additional fighting abilities.
The two special abilities they do receive immediately are the Lance Attack maneuver and Set
Spear vs. Charge maneuver. These maneuvers
are described in Chapter 8.
At higher experience levels, some fighters receive specific special abilities, including Fighter
Combat Options and other abilities; these are also described in Chapter 8.
Higher Experience Levels
A fighter with enough money may build himself a home, even a castle, before he reaches 9th
experience level. However, this home has no official sanction; even if it is a castle, the character
is not a ruler or a nobleman.
When a fighter reaches Name level (9th
level), the character is, owing to his great abilities and reputation, addressed as Lord (if male)
or Lady (if female). This is status within his community even if it is not a formal title; it is for the
DM to decide whether or not it is a formal title
bestowed upon the fighter by the nation's rulers.
At Name level, the fighter will have to decide
whether he intends to be a "land-owning fighter" (i.e., a ruler in his own right, and lord of a
region of land) or a "traveling fighter" (one who
may own homes but not rule land, and has no
especially strong responsibilities to the nation's
rulers). Don't be confused by these names. A
land-owning fighter may spend a lot of time
traveling and adventuring, and a traveling fighter may spend a lot of his time at home.
Land-Owning Fighters
There are two ways for a fighter to become a
land-owning fighter: independently or in fealty
to a greater ruler.
The DM decides on what sort of government is
used in his campaign. Assuming that it's based
on medieval Europe, as is the case with many
D&D® game campaigns, a nation's government
consists in part of a king and queen ruling a
strong court of dukes, counts and barons, each of
whom rules a smaller territory or fiefdom.
In order to become a ruler within an existing
country, he will have to petition the country's
rulers for a grant of land. If he has already done
them great services in the past, they may give it
to him immediately and gratefully, but if he is
not already their friend or ally, they may send
him on a difficult quest so that he can prove
himself to them. Once he has been granted the
land, he may build his castle upon it (at his own
expense). The land may be occupied or not; if it
is unoccupied, the prospective ruler had best try
to lure settlers there soon, so that his dominion
will begin receiving tax revenues.
At the very least, a land-owning fighter within
an existing country will be granted the title of
Baron (if male) or Baroness (if female), or the
equivalent. If he continues to expand his land
within the nation's laws and to make his dominion an increasingly strong and rich one, he may
receive greater titles, such as Count/Countess
and Duke /Duchess.
If the fighter wishes to make his dominion in a
wilderness which is not within an existing country, he may call himself anything he wants—
baron, duke, king, emperor. However, be aware
that a too-glorious title will make others laugh at
him. If he takes a title, it should be appropriate
to the size and strength of the dominion he is
ruling; he may wish to change his title as it increases in size and prosperity.
Traveling Fighters
If, at 9th level, a fighter does not decide to
make a dominion for himself, he chooses to become a traveling fighter (you can use the term
even if he really doesn't do a lot of traveling).
Traveling fighters don't usually have the political

power that land-owning fighters do, but they
can receive special abilities to help compensate
for that. (Note that we said can. They don't receive these abilities automatically.)
The alignment of a traveling fighter determines special abilities and other characteristics.
Paladins
A Lawful traveling fighter may be known as a
paladin if he meets the following requirements.
If he does not meet those requirements, he may
become a knight (described below).
1. The fighter must swear fealty (an oath of service) to a Lawful clerical order to gain paladin
status. The fighter must be of Name level or
greater to be accepted by the clerical order.
Thereafter, the paladin may be summoned
by the order's leaders at any time, and must
do as they command, as long as the service
aids the powers of Good.
2. A paladin can detect evil (as per the cleric
spell) as often as once per round, simply by
concentrating. (Range: 120'. The paladin
cannot use this ability and attack in the same
round.)
3. If the paladin's Wisdom score is 13 or greater,
the character can cast cleric spells as if he were
a cleric of one-third his actual experience
level (round any fraction down); if a fighter
becomes a paladin right at 9th level, he'll immediately gain the spells of a 3rd level cleric.
A 17th level paladin can cast spells as if he
were a 5th level cleric. If his Wisdom score is
12 or less, the fighter can still be a paladin,
but cannot cast spells.
The paladin learns how to meditate and
cast spells from the clerics of the order. The
clerics will refuse any offer of compensation
or payment for this service.
4. A paladin can turn undead, as if he were a
cleric of one-third his actual experience level
(round all fractions down). Therefore, a 6th
or 7th level paladin can turn undead with the
same ability of a 2nd level cleric.
5. A paladin may only travel with a number of
hirelings equal to or less than his clerical
level. In other words, if he can cast spells or
turn undead as a 5th level cleric, he can have
five hirelings accompany him.
6. A paladin must assist anyone who asks for
help—with two exceptions: He does not have
to help evil characters or achieve evil goals,
and if the paladin is on a mission for a higher
authority (such as a quest, serving a duke,
etc.), he can offer only a small amount of
help (such as sheltering or advising the person in need of aid), along with an explanation for his refusal. Assistance never involves
donations of money or items, but only service
for a short time.
Knights
A Neutral traveling fighter may become a
knight. Lawful traveling fighters who do not become paladins, or Chaotic traveling fighters who
do not become an avengers (described below) are
also able to become knights.
To gain knighthood, a fighter must swear fealty to a prince, king, or emperor. In return, the
ruler will declare the character a knight; that
ruler then becomes the knight's "liege."
In most campaigns, knights are the most common sort of traveling fighters. The following
rules apply to knights.
1. If summoned by his liege the knight must report to him as quickly as possible, and must
serve as the liege orders.
2. If the knight ever refuses to obey the liege, or
ever swears fealty to any other liege, the
knight loses three levels of experience. (The
DM may increase this penalty if the offense
warrants it.) The previous liege may even order the offender slain for his treachery. In addition, rumors and tales of the "traitorous
knight" may haunt the character forever after; the character may find it difficult to find
help in places where his reputation is known.
If his liege dies, the knight is free to choose
another. Additional benefits (lands, money,
etc.) may be awarded to knights who swear
fealty to the successor of a liege who dies.
A knight may petition the liege for a
peaceful end to his oath; however rarely
granted. The knight would be banished, at
the least, and could be stripped of all possessions as well.
3. A knight may visit any castle, of any territory,
and request sanctuary. The castle owner
must, by the customs of the land, give the
knight a place to stay for up to three days,
along with food and drink. He does not have
to be friendly to the knight, but, according
to this custom, may not challenge, attack, or
refuse sanctuary to the knight. (Note that the
knight cannot challenge or attack his host or
members of his host's court or family, either.
Should he do so, his sanctuary is at an end,
and his host is now free to punish him.) In
campaigns modeled after medieval Europe,
this custom is nearly universal, but the DM is
free to indicate that the custom is not present
if his nations are not similar to Europe's.
4. If a call to arms sounds (a call for knights to
battle for justice), the knight must respond.
This declaration can only be issued by the
ruler of a large town (Mayor) or territory
(Archduke or greater status), and the knight
need only respond if it sounds in the area
through which he is passing or if it is called
by his liege. When the call to arms sounds,
the knight must immediately travel as fast as
possible to the ruling castle of the one who
made the call to arms, and fight as ordered
by the ruler—within the constraints of any
knightly oaths he took in the course of the
campaign. (If the ruler who made the call to
arms orders him to kill innocents or helpless
prisoners, the knight may choose to refuse,
but he will make an enemy of that ruler.) The
knight is entitled to compensation for this
service; the ruler issuing the call to arms must
grant the knight a gift appropriate to the value of the knight's services. (Many rulers will
offer the gift out of gratitude; some will not.
The knight has the right to demand the gift;
he does not have to demand it if he does not
wish to.)
There are two notable exceptions to the
custom of the call to arms. In lands where the
civilization is very different from medieval
Europe, this custom might not be used (in
wilderness areas where there are no rulers, it
would naturally be unknown). If the knight
is within a territory that has declared itself
hostile to the knight's liege, the knight need
not respond—if the call to arms is against the
land of his liege, he must not respond. In
fact, the knight would be in great danger
when the call to arms sounds.
Avengers
A Chaotic traveling fighter may become an
avenger if he meets the following requirements.
Otherwise, a Chaotic traveling fighter may also
become a knight.
1. The fighter must make an alliance with a
Chaotic clerical order. This is not a swearing
an oath of fealty, but a loose agreement of
loyalty and support; the order may decline
the offer. If the order accepts, the order's
leaders may summon the avenger at any
time, and he must do as they command. If he
disobeys them, he loses all special abilities
and benefits of the avenger. Even then, the
fighter may regain avenger status by negotiating with a different order.
2. An avenger can detect evil (as the cleric spell)
up to once per round, simply by concentrating. (Range: 120'. The avenger may not use
this ability and attack in the same round.)
3. If the avenger's Wisdom score is 13 or greater,
the avenger can learn to cast cleric spells as if
he were a cleric of one-third his actual experience level (round all fractions down). Therefore, a 12th-l4th level avenger casts spells as
a 4th level cleric. If his Wisdom score is 12 or
less, the fighter can still be an avenger, but
cannot cast spells.
The avenger learns how to meditate and
cast spells from the clerics of the order—but
at a price (the price is at the DM's discretion,
but a minimum of 10,000 gp per clerical
spell level gained is recommended).
4. An avenger may turn undead as if he were a
cleric of one-third his actual experience level,
but with an important difference. If the result is "turn" or "destroy," the avenger may
choose to control them instead. If control is
chosen, it lasts for 1 turn per level of the
avenger—thus, a 17th level avenger could
control them for 17 turns. Undead thus controlled behave as if charmed, obeying the
avenger as if they were friends.
However, if the undead are turned or destroyed by a cleric during the duration of the
control, the control is dispelled immediately,
and cannot be renewed. If the duration of
the control ends without incident, the undead will flee (as if turned).
5. An avenger may not have human or demihuman hirelings. However, the avenger may
try to persuade monsters of Chaotic alignment to become his hirelings. If a Chaotic
creature is not immediately hostile, the
avenger may offer food or treasure, indicating (through word or gestures) friendship. If
this fails, threats or combat resulting in surrender may accomplish nearly the same result. If the creature's Reaction roll indicates
friendship, the creature is persuaded to follow and obey the avenger. The effect lasts for
a duration identical to a charm magic-user
spell; once it ends, it cannot be renewed. The
avenger may have the number of Chaotic
monster hirelings that his Charisma score allows for; once he loses one, he may try to persuade another.
6. An avenger may visit any castle, ruin, or
dungeon known to be ruled by an intelligent
Chaotic monster or character and, using his
alignment tongue, demand Sanctuary (see
knight, above). An avenger may pretend to
be a knight and request Sanctuary of other
rulers; if he deceives the ruler (and is not
tripped up by some alignment-revealing
magic), the ruler will provide him with normal Sanctuary.
Changing Back and Forth
Once a player decides to be a traveling or
land-owning fighter, only a major development
in the campaign or in the character should
change that status. The DM should discourage
frequent or casual changes of the fighter's status.
Magic-User
Prime Requisite: Intelligence.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Intelligence 13- 15, 10% for Intelligence 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d4 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, +1 hit point per
level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.
Maximum Level: 36.
Armor: None; no shield permitted.
Weapons: Dagger only. Optional (DM's
discretion): staff, blowgun, flaming oil, holy
water, net, thrown rock, sling, whip.
Special Abilities: Magical spells.
A magic-user is a human character who studies the powers of magic. Magic-users find spells,
put them into books, and study those books to
learn the spells. Magic-users have their own
spells, entirely different from clerical spells. A
magic-user has poor fighting skills, and should
avoid combat.
A magic-user concentrates on learning and
casting magic spells. He'll find that a high Intelligence is very helpful. The magic-user's other
ability scores are often low. However, a high
Constitution score will help your magic-user survive longer, because it gives a bonus to hit
points—one of the magic-user's weaker traits.
Magic-users greatly fear damage. All the other
character classes can use armor of some kind, but
magic-users can only wear clothes. Thus, they
are easy to hit. They also have few hit points.
Magic-users start as the weakest characters,
but can eventually become the most powerful.
Their magical spells can be used for many
things—from simple things like opening doors
and locks, to impressive and dangerous magical
attacks such as throwing lightning. All details on
spellcasting are given in Chapter 3.
However, it is often difficult for magic-users to survive. Their few weapons and spells (at low
levels) balance against the power they eventually
achieve. Therefore, magic-users must be cautious at lower levels, as few will survive long
without protection.

Your magic-user should not go on adventures
alone; because of his low defenses and hit
points, one surprise could kill him. In groups, he
should always stay in the middle of the party,
protected from attacks, and use his magic in
ways that will help win the fight.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A magic-user's prime requisite is Intelligence. If a magic-user has an Intelligence score of 13-15, the character gains a 5%
bonus to experience points earned in every adventure; if he has an Intelligence of 16-18, the
bonus is 10%.
Hit Dice: Roll a 4-sided die (Id4) to determine a magic-user's hit points. A magic-user starts with 1d4 (1-4) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d4 more hit points
(plus bonus) with each level of experience. One
additional hit point is gained for each level after
9th level.
Armor: A magic-user cannot wear any kind of
armor, and cannot use a shield.
Weapons: A magic-user may only use daggers
as weapons. Optionally, at the DM's discretion,
magic-users can use the staff, blowgun, flaming
oil, holy water, net, thrown rock, sling, and
whip.
Special Abilities
The magic-user's sole special ability is that he
can cast magic spells. The processes of spell book
and new spell acquisitions, as well as how the
magic-user memorizes and casts spells, are described in Chapter 3.

Higher Experience Levels
At Name (9th) level or greater, a magic-user is
called a wizard (if male) or maga (female). Also
at Name level, a magic-user may create magical
items.
Upon reaching Name level, a magic-user may
build a tower (if he can afford to). A magic-user
who constructs a tower will usually attract 1d6
(1-6) apprentices, all magic-users of experience
levels 1-3. The DM will decide how many apprentices arrive to serve the wizard, and should
create names, backgrounds, and character sheets
for them; they should be complete characters.
If a Name level magic-user decides to build a
tower, or to take up regular residence in the
home of a ruler who wishes to employ him, he is
referred to as a land-owning magic-user; otherwise, he is a traveling magic-user (even if he actually spends more time in his own home than
on the road).
Land-Owning Magic-Users:
Independent Wizards
Magic-users who decide to live in their own
strongholds, regardless of their political affiliations or interest in the outer world, are referred
to as independent wizards. They are commonly
referred to and addressed as wizard or maga,
whatever their actual titles may be.
An independent magic-user may build or
seize a tower. By tradition, he need not seek permission from the local ruler beforehand. If, however, the wizard does seek the ruler's permission,
the ruler will probably give the magic-user a lavish gift, official title to the dominion, and possibly some sort of official rank of nobility to keep
the favor of the character. (Only the most powerful of rulers would dare to offend a magic-user,
whatever their alignment differences.)
After the magic-user moves into his tower, he
may choose to build a dungeon beneath or near
it. Most wizards and magas employ specialists to
do their mining and engineering, but may decide to create the dungeons themselves if they
know the proper spells.
Of course, any character building a stronghold
could also build a dungeon, a subterranean complex where prisoners can be kept and the character can perform specific researches in secret. But
a wizard can choose for his dungeon to be different. If, once one or more levels of the dungeon
are completed, the wizard leaves an unguarded
opening into the dungeon, monsters will be attracted and will build lairs. Some wizards encourage this sort of thing so that they have ready
access to a variety of different monster types
(useful for research, and for staying aware of
what's happening in the realms of monsters).
Such monster-infested dungeons are not
looked upon favorably by humans in the region.
Dungeons tend to make the locals nervous, and
the monsters in them often prey on nearby human communities. Wizards who create these
dungeons need to be aware that low level adventurers may take action against the monsters of
these dungeons, either to keep the region safe or
simply to fill their own coffers with the monsters' treasure.
Independent wizards do not usually live in complete solitude. They may or may not interact with
the rulers and nobles of the nations in which they
live, as they please. They may continue to go on
quests and adventures with their old friends. Other
wizards may visit and correspond with them in order to facilitate magical research and understanding. They might participate in the operation of
schools of magic. Only the most misanthropic of
wizards, or those with much to hide, build their
towers in the most dangerous and inaccessible areas
and live there alone.
Land-Owning Magic-Users: Magists
If a land-owning magic-user cannot or does
not want to maintain a tower, the character may
apply for a position as a magist in any existing
castle or stronghold. If the ruler does not have a
magist and can afford one, he will usually accept
the application . . . unless the wizard has so vile a
reputation that the ruler cannot trust the wizard.
The magist advises the ruler in matters involving
magic and handles the magical needs of the ruler
and the stronghold.
To become a magist, the magic-user must first
find a ruler who is willing to hire and support
him. He must negotiate payment and other benefits with the ruler. (Standard payment is a minimum of 3,000 gold pieces per month, with
magists above 15th level commanding higher
payment.) Finally, the character must swear an oath of fealty to that ruler to become a magist.
When the agreements and terms are complete, the ruler supplies all the magist's needs,
including a place to stay in the stronghold (usually a suite of several rooms), guards and servants, and other agreed-upon benefits (such as
magical items, either to use or as outright gifts).
The ruler usually pays for magical research costs
if the item or spell researched will benefit the
stronghold. The magist must serve the ruler as
ordered in all respects, but is never required to
fight or otherwise be placed in danger.
A magist may go on normal adventures if the
ruler gives permission. The ruler knows that
more experience means a more powerful magist,
and will usually give permission if no immediate
magical needs are pressing.
The magist is bound by oath not to work
against the interests of his ruler. If at some time
in the future he finds that he cannot serve the
ruler, he must officially renounce his oath of fealty and depart the ruler's home. He cannot oppose his former ruler until he has left the ruler's
home. (If he intends to become an enemy of the
ruler, it's best for him to depart in secret and
send his official notification by proxy.)
Traveling Magic-Users: Magi
A traveling magic-user of either gender is
known as a magus.
1. A magus may visit any land-owning magicuser to offer to help with magical research. If
the offer is accepted, items or spells researched will be completed faster and more
efficiently, as described in Chapter 3. 2. The magus will attract powerful traveling
fighters and clerics, who offer to travel with
and help the magus in return for pay. The
magus attracts 1d6 such hirelings. These
hirelings are of levels much higher than normal (5th level minimum).
High Experience Levels and Spell Damage
Here's one final but very important note
about high level magic-users:
Any damage-causing spell can produce a maximum of 20 dice of damage (of whatever type is
applicable). Therefore, a 16th level magic-user
casting a fireball spell can deal out 16d6 points
of damage, but a 27th level caster only inflicts
the maximum of 20d6 points of damage.
Thief
Prime Requisite: Dexterity.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Dexterity 13- 15, 10% for Dexterity 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d4 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, +2 hit points per
level, and Constitution adjustments no longer apply.
Maximum Level: 36.
Armor: Leather armor only; shield not permitted.
Weapons: Any missile weapon; any onehanded melee weapon.
Special Abilities: At 1st level—Open
Locks, Find Traps, Remove Traps, Climb
Walls, Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, Pick
Pockets, Hear Noise, and Backstab; at 4th
level—Read any normal language 80%; at
10th level—cast magic-user spells from scrolls
(10% chance of backfire). For the chances of
success for these abilities, see "Special Abilities" below.
A thief is a human who specializes in stealth,
lockpicking, trap removing, and other such activities. As the name indicates, however, most
characters belonging to the thief class do steal.
(They rarely steal from their friends or members
of their own groups, however. A thief who steals
from friends is usually not permitted to adventure with them ever again!)
Thieves belong to an organization (sometimes
called a Guild). Every town has a building,
called the Guild Hall, where thieves may live
and eat (for a price, of course). Every thief learns
"the Arts" (a thief's unique skills; see "Special
Abilities," below) from teachers at the Guild.
Thieves are a normal part of life in most campaign worlds because of their unique and useful
skills, but they are not usually welcome in the
better pans of towns.
The thief's job is to use his special abilities
where needed. A thief's skills can be very useful,
and they can be used over and over. For example, a magic-user may use a spell to open a lock,
but the spell only works once; a thief may try to
open locks whenever desired. Consequently,
thieves are found in most groups of adventurers.
Most thieves have high Dexterity scores. Since
this can improve their ability to use missile
weapons, most thieves use one or more types of
missiles. The thief will also find it useful to have
a sword or dagger in situations where he can't
avoid close combat.
Thieves may advance to 36th level.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A thief's prime requisite is
Dexterity. If a thief has a Dexterity score of 13-
15, he gains a 5% bonus to experience points
earned in every adventure; if his Dexterity is 16-
18, the bonus is 10%.
Hit Dice: Roll a 4-sided die (1d4) to determine a thief's hit points. A thief starts with 1d4
(1-4) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any)
and gains 1d4 more hit points (plus bonus) with
each level of experience. Two additional hit
points are gained for each level after 9th level.
Armor: A thief may only wear leather armor,
and may not use a shield.
Weapons: A thief may use any missile weapon, and any other weapon usable with one hand
(two-handed weapons are prohibited).
Special Abilities
Thieves have numerous special abilities. They
receive some of them at 1st experience level,
when they begin play, and receive others as they
gain experience levels.
At 1st experience level, thieves know the following skills: Open Locks, Find and Remove
Traps, Climb Walls, Move Silently, Hide in
Shadows, Pick Pockets, and Hear Noise. They also learn the skill of Backstabbing. The Thief
Special Abilities Table shows the development of
many of the thief's special abilities.
The column on the left is the thief's experience level; cross-reference his level with the skill
he is trying to use. For instance, a 6th level thief
using his Climb Walls skill has a 92% chance.
Each number on the table above is the percentage chance that the thief is successful in using that special ability. Tell the Dungeon Master
whenever you want your thief to use a special
ability; at the DM's discretion, either the player
or the DM will roll percentile dice (d%). If the
result is equal to or less than the percentage
given, the thief's attempt is successful.
Descriptions of the Special Abilities
Open Locks (OL): With successful use of this
special ability, and with professional lockpicks
(often called "thieves' tools"), the thief may
open locks. The character may try to use this skill
only once per lock. The thief may not try again
with that particular lock until he gains another
level of experience. Without lockpicks, he may
not use this ability.
Find Traps (FT): With successful use of this
special ability, the thief may examine a room or
an object and determine whether it is rigged
with traps. He may check only once per trap, and
failure prevents the character from finding any
trap in or on the object searched. (Since the DM
actually does the rolling, the player doesn't
know how many traps he's rolling to find.) If the
thief finds a trap, he may use his Remove Traps
ability to remove or deactivate it.
Remove Traps (RT): With successful use of
this special ability, the thief may remove or deactivate a trap. He may not roll this ability against
a trap unless the trap has been found. The thief
may try his ability only once per trap; failure to
remove a trap triggers the trap.
Climb Walls (CW): With successful use of this
special ability, the thief can climb steep surfaces,
such as sheer cliffs, walls, and so forth. The
chances for success are good, but if failed, the

thief slips at the halfway point and falls. The
DM rolls for success once for every 100' climbed.
If the roll is a failure, the thief takes 1-6 (1d6)
points of damage per 10' fallen. Falling during a
10' climb will inflict 1 point of damage.
Move Silently (MS): Successful use of this special ability allows the thief to move silently.
When the thief tries to use this skill, he always
believes he has been successful, but a failed roll
means that someone can hear his passage. The
DM, at his discretion, may modify the thief's roll
at any time: When he tries moving silently across
a field of dried leaves, his percentage chance
would go down, while if he does so during a loud
tournament, his chance will be greatly enhanced. Note that it doesn't do the thief any
good to use this skill against someone who is already aware of him.
Hide in Shadows (HS): Successful use of this
special ability means that the thief moves into
and remains in shadows, making him very hard
to see. While the thief is in shadows, observers
only get a chance to see him if they look directly
at him, at which time he must roll again; success
means that he remains unobserved. While in

shadows, the thief may use his Move Silently
ability, but attacking someone reveals the thief.
If the thief tries to hide in shadows but fails, he
will not know that his position of concealment is
a failure until someone sees him and announces
the fact. Note that if the thief is under direct observation, he can't hide in shadows against the
people watching him; they'll be able to follow
his progress with no problem.
Pick Pockets (PP): This special ability allows
the character to steal things from another character's person without him noticing. It's a very
risky skill to use. If the attempt succeeds, the
thief is able to pick the other's pockets without
anyone noticing. If the roll is a simple failure,
the thief fails to get his hands on what he's seek- ing. If the roll is greater than twice what the
thief needs to succeed or an 00 in any case, the
thief is caught in the act by his intended victim,
and possibly others.
When using the skill, subtract 5% per level or
HD of victim. (Normal men—men and women
who have no adventuring ability at all and do
not belong to any adventuring character class—
are treated as being 0 level.)
Example: A 1st level thief tries to pick the
pocket of a 1st level fighter walking along the
street. His chance is 20% (normal) minus 5 (5
times 1), or 15%. The DM rolls the percentile
dice and rolls a 41. This is over twice what he
needed to roll, so the thief is caught in the act.
Hear Noise (HN): This special ability gives the
thief the ability to hear faint noises—such as
breathing on the other side of the door, or the
clatter of distant footsteps approaching fast. The
DM can rule that any loud situation, such as a
battle, prevents the thief from using this skill.

Proper Use of Thief Abilities
Watch for opportunities to use special abilities, and simply tell your Dungeon Master when
you want your thief to use one.
A stuck or exceptionally difficult lock, carefully hidden trap, slippery wall, or very faint
noise may cause a penalty to be applied to the
normal chances of successful skill use. The DM
could assign the task a penalty of - 5 %, - 10%,
-20%, or higher depending on the difficulty of
the task. If, after applying such penalties, the
chance of success remains 100% or greater, the
DM should adjust it to 99%, allowing a 1%
minimum chance of failure in all cases.
However, the DM should not modify Move Silently or Hide in Shadows skill chances unless
the thief is undertaking actions that are outside
the ability's usual functions (trying to move silently while running at full speed or across a
floor covered with peanut shells, hiding when
very near to torchlight, etc.).
Other Thief Abilities
Backstabbing: If a thief can sneak up on a victim, completely unnoticed, the thief may
backstab—if he is using a one-handed melee
weapon, he may strike at particularly vulnerable
points of his target's body. (Though the ability is
called "backstabbing," the weapon doesn't have
to be a stabbing weapon. A thief can use this
ability with a club, for example.)
When backstabbing, the thief gains a bonus
of +4 on the attack roll; if the target is hit, the
damage done is twice normal (roll the damage
for the weapon, multiply the result by two, and
then add any pertinent modifiers).
If the intended victim sees, hears, or is warned
of the thief's approach, the thief's attack is not a
backstab; it is an ordinary attack, doing the
damage appropriate for the weapon used.
When no battle is in progress, a backstab attempt may require a Move Silently ability check.
The DM will make all the necessary decisions on
that matter.
Read Languages: When the thief reaches 4th
level, he gains an 80% chance to read any normal writing or language (including simple codes,
dead languages, treasure maps, and so on, but
not magical writings). If he tries but fails to read
apiece of writing, he must gain at least one experience level before trying to read it again.
Cast Spells From Magic-User Scrolls: At 10th
level, a thief gains the ability to cast magic-user
spells from spell scrolls. However, there is always
a 10% chance that the spell will backfire, creating an unexpected result, because of the thief's
imperfect understanding of magical writings.
This ability only allows thieves to cast spells from
existing magic scrolls, not to write their own.
Higher Experience Levels
When a thief reaches Name (9th) level, he is
called a master thief (whether male or female).
Land-Owning Thieves
Name level thieves may construct a hideout (a
fortified house in a city, a cave network, etc.). A
thief who has constructed a hideout will attract
2d6 1st level apprentice thieves, who come to
learn from a master. These will generally
(though not always) be loyal to the thief, but
will not automatically be replaced by others if
they die or leave; the character will have to recruit new thieves himself.
At this point, a player character thief may
want to consider setting up a Thieves' Guild.
A thief who wishes to settle must contact the
Thieves' Guild of the region where he wants to
settle. If the thief has not been an enemy of this
Guild (or, even if he has, if he can persuade or
bribe the Guild to cooperate), the Guild will
help establish the thief as a guildmaster. He may
be the master of a new branch of the Guild, an
expansion branch in a new neighborhood, or of
an established Guild whose leader has stepped
down or died.
The Dungeon Master will describe how many
new thieves arrive at the new Guild, or will describe how the existing Guild is currently organized. The Guild will generate income from its
illegal activities.
The character can, at some point, ask for control of a larger branch of the Guild (this is recommended when 18th level is reached), and may
eventually become a powerful official in the
Guild Headquarters.
Skilled (high level) thieves are always needed
for difficult and unique adventures, and the
Guildmaster thief is the person adventurers contact when such jobs are available. You, as the
Guildmaster, may choose to take the jobs or allow one or more of the Guild members to have
them—but you have first choice, in any case.
Traveling Thieves
A Name level thief who chooses not to establish any hideout or any station in the local Guild
authority is a traveling thief, known also as a
rogue.
1. A rogue must remain a member of a Thieves'
Guild, though he need visit the Guild only
once a year.
2. Once a character becomes a rogue, the character can never become a Guildmaster in an established branch of the Guild. However, if he
later decides to settle down, and if the Guildmaster permits, he may set up a new branch of
the Guild where none currently exists.
3. A rogue has a chance (checked by the DM
once per game week) of discovering treasure
maps or rumors about the location of great
treasures. This chance is based on him keeping his ear to the thieves' grapevine.
4. Likewise, the rogue may visit any branch of
the Thieves' Guild to see the Guildmaster
and learn local information, tips, and
rumors—if the local Guildmaster is willing to
suffer his presence in the territory. If the
Guildmaster is willing, it will only be under
the condition that the character hire assistance from several low level thieves on a temporary basis.
Dwarf
Prime Requisite: Strength. Other Requirements: Constitution 9 or better.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15,
10% for Strength 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d8 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, + 3 hp per level and
Constitution adjustments no longer apply.
Maximum Level: 12.
Armor: Any; shields permitted.
Weapons: Any Small or Medium melee
weapon; short bows and crossbows permitted, but longbows forbidden.
Special Abilities: Fighter Maneuvers
(Lance Attack and Set Spear vs. Charge maneuvers at 1st level; at 660,000 XP, Fighter
Combat Options); half damage from spells at
1,400,000 XP; infravision; extra languages
(dwarf, gnome, goblin, kobold); 1 in 3
chance to detect traps, sliding walls, sloping
corridors, new construction.
A dwarf is short and stocky, standing about 4'
tall and weighing about 150 pounds. Male
dwarves wear long beards. Their skin is ruddy or
earth-colored and their hair is dark brown, gray,
or black. Stubborn but practical, dwarves are
fond of good food and drink. They value craftsmanship and love gold. Dwarves are sturdy
fighters and are resistant to magic.
Although the dwarf class is different from the
fighter class in many ways, their tasks are the
same. Dwarves are only able to attain a maximum of 12 experience levels at best. However,
this is balanced by the dwarfs special abilities,
such as the ability to see in the dark, detection
abilities, and better saving throws. Dwarves are
formidable fighters, no matter what their level.
Dwarven families are organized in Clans.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A dwarfs prime requisite is
Strength. If a dwarf has a Strength score of 13-
15, the character gains a 5 % bonus to experience
points earned in every adventure; if his Strength
is 16-18, the bonus is 10%.
Minimum Scores: A dwarf character must
have a Constitution score of 9 or greater when
first played.
Hit Dice: Roll an 8-sided die (1d8) to determine a dwarfs hit points. A dwarf starts with
1d8 (1-8) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if
any) and gains 1d8 more hit points (plus bonus)
with each experience level. Three hit points are
gained per level after 9th level.
Armor: A dwarf may wear any kind of armor,
and may use a shield.
Weapons: A dwarf may use any small or medium melee weapon. (If you're unsure as to
whether a weapon is small or medium, see the
Weapons Table in Chapter 4.) They may not use
longbows, but can use short bows and crossbows.
Special Abilities
Special Attacks
Dwarves are good fighters. Like fighters, they
know the Lance Attack and Set Spear vs. Charge
maneuvers.
Fighter Combat Options
When the dwarfs experience points total
reaches 660,000, he gains the Fighter Combat
Options (see "Combat Maneuvers" in Chapter 8).
With the multiple attacks combat option, the
dwarf can make two attacks at 660,000 experience points, and three at 2,200,000 experience
points. He can use the smash and parry combat
options, but cannot use the disarm option
against a giant-sized opponent. (A giant-sized
opponent is any monster which is described as
being a giant, a giant animal, a gargantua, or is
otherwise in the DM's opinion enormous.)

Special Defenses
Experienced dwarves become more resistant to
magic. When the dwarf reaches the 1,400,000
experience point mark, the dwarf automatically
takes only half damage from any damagecausing spell or spell-like effect (such as from a
magical item or strange monster powers such as
beholders' eyes but not including dragon's
breath). Divide the rolled damage by 2 and
round down. If the effect allows a saving throw,
a successful roll indicates that he only takes 1/4
damage; divide the rolled damage by 4 and
round down. (If the result is 1/2 point of damage
or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.)
Infravision
Infravision is the ability to see heat (and the
lack of heat). Dwarves have infravision in addition to normal sight and can see 60' in the dark.
Infravision does not work in the presence of normal and magical light. With infravision, warm
things appear red, and cold things appear blue.
A creature could be seen as a red shape, leaving
faint reddish footprints. A cold pool of water
would seem a deep blue color. Characters with infravision can even see items
or creatures the same temperature as the surrounding air (such as a table or a skeleton), since
air flow will inevitably show the viewer their borders, outlining them in a faint lighter-blue tone.
Until they move, they will be very faint to the

eye; once they start moving, they become blurry
but very obvious light-blue figures.
Infravision isn't good enough to read by. A
character can use his infravision to recognize an
individual only if they are within 10' distance
. . . unless the individual is very, very distinctive
(for example, 8' tall or walking with a crutch).
Languages
In addition to Common and alignment
tongues, a dwarf can speak the languages of the
dwarf, gnome, goblin, and kobold races.
Detection
Dwarves can sometimes detect traps (specifically, traps built into stone-work or heavy construction, not other types of traps such as
rope-traps in the forest or spring-out needles
built into a jewelry box); they can also detect
sliding walls, sloping corridors, and new constructions.
If your dwarf character wants to search for such
things in an area, tell the DM. You have 1 chance
in 3 to find them. The DM will roll 1d6, and a 1
or 2 will indicate success if there is anything to
find; a result of 3-6 means your dwarf detects
nothing. You may check once for each trap, sliding wall, sloping corridor, or new construction.
You must tell the DM if you want to look for anything; the detection is never automatic.
Higher Experience Levels
When a dwarf reaches Name (9th) level, he is
usually referred to as a dwarf lord (or dwarf lady,
in the case of female dwarves).
He may build a stronghold. Unless he has forsaken his dwarven Clan and is living among humans, it should be an underground cavern
complex located in either mountains or hills. (If
he is living among humans, he may build any
sturdy stone dwelling in the human fashion instead, but will still want for there to be an
underground complex connected to it.) The

An elf is slender and graceful, with delicate
features and pointed ears. An elf is 5' to 5 1/2'
tall, and weighs about 120 pounds.
Elves are able to use all types of armor and
weapons, and can cast magical spells.
Few elves are adventurers; most prefer to
spend their time feasting and frolicking in woodland glades. Except for adventurers, elves rarely
visit the cities of man.
Elves are fascinated by magic and never grow
tired of collecting spells and magical items, especially if the items are beautifully crafted.
Elves are similar to both fighters and magicusers. Read the description of the fighter class for
some tips on playing a fighter-type character,
but remember that the elf does not have as many
hit points as a fighter. The elf can best perform
as a fighter if he is undamaged or only slightly
hurt before entering a battle; otherwise, he
should stay back and help with magic spells, as a
magic-user does.
An elf may only advance to 10th level. However, this is balanced by the elf's special abilities,
especially the combination of fighting and
spellcasting. This combination makes an elf far
more powerful than a human of the same level.
Elves only employ other elves as mercenary
fighters, although they may hire specialists and
hirelings of any race.
Elven families live in Clans.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: Elves have two prime requisites: Strength and Intelligence. If an elf has a
score of 13 or more in both ability scores, he
gains a 5% bonus to experience points earned. If
his Intelligence score is 16-18 and his Strength is
13 or more, the bonus is 10%.
Minimum Scores: An elf character must have
Intelligence 9 or greater when first played. Hit Dice: Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine an elf's hit points. An elf starts with 1d6
(1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any)
and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus) with
each level of experience. Two additional hit
points are gained at 10th level.
Armor: An elf may wear any kind of armor,
and may use a shield.
Weapons: An elf may use any weapon.
Special Abilities
Special Attacks After reaching maximum level (10th), elves
may continue to improve in combat ability. This
is a slow process, however, due to the fact that
they must divide their training time between
fighting and magic. Elves always know the following fighter maneuvers: Set Spear vs. Attack;
Lance Attack.
Fighter Combat Options
When the character's experience point total
reaches 850,000, the character receives the Combat Options for fighters (see their description on
page 104, under "Combat Maneuvers"). With
multiple attacks, two attacks are possible at
850,000 experience points, and three attacks at
2,600,000 experience points; the elf never gains
four attacks per round. The elf may use the
smash, parry, and disarm options as described in
the text.
Special Defenses Experienced elves become more resistant to
dragon breath. When the elf reaches the
1,600,000 experience points mark, he automatically takes only half damage from any breath
weapon (most notably dragon breath, but including all sorts of breath weapon attacks). If the
breath allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates that the elf takes only one-quarter damage. When modifying damage sustained, always
round down. If the result is 1/2 point of damage
or less, the character takes 1 point of damage.
Infravision
Elves have infravision identical to that of
dwarves. See the description of infravision in the
explanation of the dwarfs special abilities.
Languages
In addition to the languages of all
characters—the Common and alignment
tongues—an elf can speak the languages of the
elf, gnoll, hobgoblin, and ore races.
Detection
All elves can find secret and hidden doors better than other characters. "You must tell the DM
if you want to look for secret and hidden doors;
the detection is never automatic.
Immunity to Ghoul Paralysis
All elves are naturally immune to the paralyzing attacks of ghouls. Other types of paralysis,
such as attacks from a carrion crawler or gelatinous cube, do affect them normally.
Spells
Elves can use magic-user spells just as magicusers can, though they receive fewer and lower
level spells. Spell are described in Chapter 3.

Higher Experience Levels
When the elf reaches Namc (9th) level, he is
often referred to as a lord wizard (if male) or lady
maga (if female).
He may build a special kind of stronghold
deep in the forest. This stronghold must pleasingly blend with its surroundings, usually a natural site of great beauty. Typical locations are the
tops of great trees, on the edges of quiet vales, or
behind rushing waterfalls. Because of the effort
to beautify the work, the structure costs as much
as similar work if made of stone.
When the stronghold is completed, the character will develop a friendship with the animals
of the forest (birds, rabbits, squirrels, foxes,
bears, etc.). All normal animals within five miles
of the stronghold will be friendly toward the
elves dwelling there. Animals will be able to
warn of approaching strangers, carry news of
events, deliver short messages to nearby places,
etc. In return for these services, the animals will
expect the elves to help and protect them.
Halfling
Prime Requisite: Strength and Dexterity.
Other Requirements: Dexterity of 9 or better, Constitution of 9 or better.
Experience Bonus: 5% for either Strength
or Dexterity of 13 or more, 10% for both
Strength and Dexterity of 13 or more.
Hit Dice: 1d6 per level up to 8th level.
Maximum Level: 8.
Armor: Any; shield is permitted; armor
must be designed specifically for halflings.
Weapons: Any Small melee weapon; short
bow; light crossbow.
Special Abilities: Fighter Maneuver (Set
Spear vs. Charge); at 900,000 XP, Fighter
Combat Options); Combat Bonuses (- 2 AC
vs. monsters larger than man-size, +1 to attack roll with missile weapons, + 1 to Individual Initiative); half damage from spells at
300,000 XP, half damage from dragon breath
at 2,100,000 XP; 90% chance to hide motionless in woodlands, 33% chance to hide
motionless in dimly lit building interiors.
A halfling is a short demihuman, and looks
much like a human child with slightly pointed
ears. A halfling stands about 3' tall and weighs
about 60 pounds. Halflings rarely have beards.
Halflings are outgoing but not unusually
brave, seeking treasure as a way to gain the comforts of home, which they so dearly love. Halflings prefer to live in pleasant areas of fair
countryside near rolling hills and gentle streams.
When not working or adventuring, halflings will
spend most of their time eating, drinking, talking with friends, and relaxing. Their communities are called shires, and their recognized
spokesman is called a Sheriff. Halfling families
live in Clans.
Halflings are woodland folk, and usually get
along well with elves and dwarves. They have
special abilities in the outdoors. Halflings
behave similarly to fighters and dwarves. A halfling's saving throws are as good as those of
dwarves. Halflings may only advance to 8th
level. This limitation is balanced by their

bonuses.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A halfling has two prime
requisites: Strength and Dexterity. If cither of
these ability scores is 13 or greater, the character
gains a 5 % bonus to experience points earned in
every adventure. If both of these scores are 13 or
greater, the experience points bonus is 10%.
Minimum Scores: A halfling character must
have a score of 9 or greater in both Dexterity and
Constitution.
Hit Dice: Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine a halfling's hit points. A halfling starts
with 1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if any) and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus
bonus) with each level of experience.
Armor: A halfling may wear any kind of armor, and may use a shield. However, their armor
and shields must be specially made for their
small size. Even dwarf-sized armor is too large
for them.
Weapons: A halfling may use any Small melee
weapon and may use short bows and light crossbows. (If you're unsure whether a weapon is
Small or not, see the Weapons Table found in
Chapter 4.)
Special Abilities
Combat Bonuses
All halflings gain the following bonuses when
in combat.
Halfling Combat Bonuses Table
- 2 bonus to armor class when attacked by
creatures larger than man-sized (i.e.,
an AC of 6 becomes a 4)
+ 1 bonus to the attack roll when using any
missile weapon
+1 bonus to individual initiative (see
Chapter 8 for details on Initiative)
A creature is larger than man-sized when it is
referred to as "giant," "gargantuan," or "enormous" in a monster description. It is likewise
larger than man-sized if it is a real-world creature
which the DM considers bigger than a man (for
example, a horse). As a rule of thumb, any nonhuman-shaped creature whose size is not otherwise given in a description can be presumed to
be larger than man-sized if it has 4 or more HD.
Special Attacks
In combat, a halfling may use the Set Spear
vs. Charge maneuver, as described in Chapter 8
under "Combat Maneuvers." They are too small
to utilize the Lance Attack maneuver, however.

Fighter Combat Options
When the halfling's experience point total
reaches 900,000, he gains the Fighter Combat
Options on page 104. For the multiple attacks
option, two attacks are possible at 900,000 experience points, and three attacks at 3,000,000 experience points. The halfling can use the smash
and parry options as described, but cannot use
the disarm option effectively against a giantsized opponent.
Special Defenses
Experienced halflings become more resistant
to both magic and breath weapons. When the
halfling reaches the 300,000 experience point
mark, he automatically takes only half damage
from any damage-causing spell or spell-like effect (such as from a magical item). If the effect
allows a saving throw, a successful roll indicates
that he takes only 1/4 damage.
In addition, when the halfling reaches the
2,100,000 experience point mark, he likewise
automatically takes only half damage from
breath weapons (most notably dragon breath,
but including all sorts of breath weapon attacks),
and takes only 1 / 4 damage if he successfully
makes a saving throw (if the attack allows one).
When modifying sustained damage, always
round fractions down. If the result is 1 / 2 point of
damage or less, the character takes 1 point of
damage.
Woodland Abilities
Outdoors, halflings are difficult to spot, having the ability to hide in woods or underbrush.
In such cover, they have a 90 % chance to remain
unseen (the DM will roll). Halflings can even
Halfling Saving Throws Table
Levels
Death Ray/Poison
Magic Wands
Paralysis/Turn to Stone
Breath Attack* Rod/Staff/Spell**
hide in building interiors such as dungeons,
though not with as much success. In such situations, if a halfling finds some deep shadows or
cover to hide in, his chance drops to 33%; if he
cannot find shadows or cover, he has no chance
at all.
This ability is not the same as the thief's Move
Silently or Hide in Shadows abilities. To use his
ability, the halfling must stay motionless. If he
tries to move to another site, anyone can see
him.
When your halfling uses this ability, inform
the DM. He'll roll percentile dice (d%) for the
halfling. On a roll of 90 or less, the halfling will
remain unnoticed. On a 91 or greater, observers
with a chance to detect the halfling will do so. In
a dungeon or other building interior, the DM
will roll d%. On a roll of 33 or less, the halfling
remains undetected; on a 34 or greater, an observer who has a chance to detect him will do so.
Indoors, a light bright enough to banish
shadows and illuminate everything well (such as
magical light) will ruin the hiding attempt. Naturally, if the halfling character is himself carrying
a light, it will be impossible for him to hide.
Higher Experience Levels
A halfling reaching 8th experience level is
usually referred to by the title of sheriff. In your
campaign, this may be a merely honorary title,
or the DM may choose to have the halfling character be elected to a local sheriffs position.
Regardless of his experience level, a halfling
may build a stronghold whenever he has the
money and the interest. The stronghold will attract a whole community of other halflings if
constructed in a place suited to their preferences.

Druid (Optional)
Prime Requisite: Wisdom. Other Requirements: Neutral alignment.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Wisdom 13-15,
10% for Wisdom 16-18.
Hit Dice: Starting with 10th level, + 1 hit
point per level, and Constitution adjustments do not apply.
Maximum Level: 36; Druid must challenge and defeat another Druid of the newlyattained experience level starting at 30th
level.
Armor: Leather armor; shield permitted if
made only of wood and leather.
Weapons: Any non-edged/non-piercing
weapon made with no metal.
Special Abilities: Spells (both druidic and
clerical).
A Neutral cleric of 9th to 29th level may
choose to study nature instead of remaining
among "civilized" areas. If he does so, he
changes character class and becomes a druid. To
become a druid, the cleric must find and live in a
woodland home, meditating for one to four
(1d4, rolled by the DM) months.
During that time, a higher level druid (usually 25th level or greater) will find the cleric,
test him for worthiness, and teach him the
principles of druidic philosophy and magic.
(The DM may prefer to handle all that in the
background, or to make a protracted roleplaying adventure out of it.) The new druid
may then join the realm of the druids.
A druid is pure Neutral, never Lawful or Chaotic. The druid devotes his life to the balance of
all things and to the study of nature.
Druid items and equipment are all made of
items that were once alive (leather, wood, etc.).
"Dead" things that have never been alive are repulsive to the druid; the character simply won't
want to use or touch them. However, the character should not object if others use "dead"
things. Thus, a druid can be a challenging character to play, but the role can be entertaining.
Druids, unlike clerics, have no power to turn
undead and so have reason to fear undead monsters. They may contact town churches if undead
monsters threaten their realms.
Every druid lives in, protects, and tends a section of woodlands. (Druids must live in a natural
setting; they cannot live in a city or town.)
Druids do not think of themselves as owners, but
rather as caretakers, of wilderness. Nearly every
tree in every woodland is cared for by a druid.
Although minor damage to the woods is a fact of
life, druids punish deliberate evil destruction of
trees or nature. Even Chaotic monsters know
this, and avoid harming things of the woods lest
they incur the wrath of the local druid.
The DM and players should be sure not to
abuse this protective role. For example, a party
foraging for food would not be attacked by a
druid unless they killed more animals than they
could eat, wantonly destroyed trees, etc.
The battles of Law and Chaos are not the affairs of the druids, and they may simply watch
such encounters from afar, helping neither side.
When characters perform good deeds in the
woodlands, such as curing wounded animals,
this does not make the druid automatically
friendly. However, assistance in fighting a huge
disaster—such as a magical storm or major forest
fire—could earn the gratitude and possible
friendship of a druid.
Should the druid change alignment, he will
retain all the clerical abilities and clerical spells
which druids can use (but will not regain his
ability to turn undead); he will lose all druid
benefits including druidic spells unless he returns to Neutral alignment.
Druids have unusual abilities that help them
in their woodland role, but they also have many
restrictions. These are described below.
Class Details
Prime Requisite: A druid's prime requisite is
Wisdom. If a druid has a Wisdom score of 13-15
the character gains a 5% bonus to experience
points earned; if his Wisdom is 16-18, he earns a
10% bonus to experience points.
Hit Dice: A character cannot become a druid
until he has reached at least Name (9th) experience level as a cleric. Therefore, from then on,
he will receive only 1 hit point per experience
level gained after 9th level.
Armor: The druid may not wear metal armor
or use metal items. He can wear leather armor
and shields made of wood and leather.
Weapons: Druids, like clerics, may not use
piercing or cutting weapons; and even of the
weapon types they can use, they may not have
weapons with metal parts. He can commission
craftsmen to make all-wooden versions of appropriate weapons; they cost 50% more than their
counterparts, but otherwise behave identically.
Abilities and Restrictions
Druid Spells
Druids can cast any spells that clerics can (except those which affect good or evil, as described
below). Druids also have access to a special list of
druid spells, which normal clerics cannot learn or
cast. The druid is not able to cast more spells per
day than a cleric, but he can use spells from both
cleric and druid spell lists. The principles of clerical and druidic magic and the lists of spells are
found in Chapter 3.
A druid cannot cast any spell that affects good
or evil (protection from evil or dispel evil, for example). He must live in a woodland home, rather than in a town or city. He may visit a city
(though he won't feel comfortable there), and
he will always prefer to sleep in the wilderness—
in a cave or other natural shelter if the weather is
bad.
Higher Experience Levels
Druids at Name (9th) level or above receive
the title of druid, whether male or female. There
are only nine druids of 30th level, seven of 31st,
five of 32nd, four of 33rd, three of 34th, two of
35th, and one of 36th (the Great Druid).
When the character reaches 30th level, he
must find and challenge one of the nine 30th
level druids; they will only fight with magic and

the player character loses, he stays at 29th level,
losing enough experience points that he is 1 experience point short of 30th level. Once he's regained 30th level, he may try again, but cannot
issue another challenge until three months have
passed since his first challenge.
Mystic (Optional)
Prime Requisite: Strength and Dexterity.
Other Requirements: Wisdom and Dexterity scores of 13 or better.
Experience Bonus: 5% for Strength 13-15,
10% for Strength 16-18.
Hit Dice: 1d6 per level up to 9th level.
Starting with 10th level, +2 hit points per

Maximum Level: 16.
Armor: None; shield not permitted.
Weapons: Any.
Special Abilities: AC bonuses, increased

Mystics are monastic humans who follow a
strict discipline of meditation, denial, seclusion,
and mastery of the human body. Mystics are
skilled in unarmed combat. They live in cloisters, or monastic communities.
Mystics adventure to gain spiritual growth and
learn the lessons of life outside the cloister. They
rarely adventure with other mystics; they prefer
to attach themselves to adventuring parties consisting of many different types of adventurers.
Mystics receive experience from treasure only
if they donate it to the needy. Also, they must
donate (tithe) ten percent of their treasure to
their cloister.
A mystic's oath is his bond. He must be true
to his oath and strive to repay all debts. Should
he forswear himself (break an oath he has made),
he is expelled from the cloister, may not gain any
new experience levels, loses one level per year
away from the cloister, and may not join any other, similar, cloister. The DM may allow him a
grand quest to regain his honor and his standing
in the cloister.
Most mystics (75%) are Lawful, though other
alignments are represented. All are utterly devoted to the mystic discipline, which is neither
good nor evil, similar in that respect to druid
philosophy. However, the mystics rely on innerstrength, and believe in extraordinary but nonmagical powers (rather than the powers of
nature, as the druids do).
Mystics can often be recognized by their robes
or other unusual garb, but another distinctive
feature is their salute. Upon meeting another
creature presumed to be peaceful, the mystic
raises a fist, covers it with the other hand, and
bows slightly. This symbolizes greetings (the
bow), readiness to fight if necessary (the fist),
but peaceful intentions (the covered fist).

Class Details
Prime Requisite: The mystic has two prime
requisites, Strength and Dexterity. But since he
must have a score of at least 13 in Dexterity to be
a mystic in the first place, it is his Strength score
that determines his bonus to experience. If a
mystic has a Strength score of 13-15 the character
gains a 5 % bonus to experience points earned in
every adventure; if his Strength is 16-18, he
earns a 10% bonus to experience points.
Minimum Scores: A mystic character must
have scores of 13 or better in both his Wisdom
and Dexterity abilities.
Hit Dice: Roll a 6-sided die (1d6) to determine a mystic's hit points. A mystic starts with
1d6 (1-6) hit points (plus Constitution bonus, if
any) and gains 1d6 more hit points (plus bonus)
with each level of experience. Two hit points are
gained for every level beyond 9th level.
Armor: Mystics can never wear armor of any
type, nor can they ever use protective magical
devices (such as rings, cloaks, etc.); they rely on
their discipline for protection.
Weapons: Mystics are trained to use all weapons, but not all mystics carry them; higher level
mystics especially travel unarmed, or armed only
with a walking-staff which doubles as a quarterstaff.
Special Abilities
Mystics have a lot of special abilities, which
help compensate for their inability to wear armor
or own personal possessions; we'll describe them
below.
Level: This column shows the mystic's experience level.
AC: This column shows the mystic's armor

become lower as they gain in experience due to
their skill in maneuvering.
MV: This column shows the mystic's movement rate. First level mystics move as fast as any
other unarmored characters, but higher level
mystics learn to move very, very fast indeed.
Hand Attacks—#AT: Mystics are very effective
fighters; as they go up in levels, they are able to
attack multiple times per round, and this
column shows how many times per round they
may attack. Mystics use this column when attacking either bare-handed or when using melee
weapons.
Hand Attacks—Damage: When mystics fight
bare-handed, they use this column to find the
amount of damage they do. They do add
Strength bonuses to the amount of damage
shown.
Martial Arts
Mystics are able to fight very effectively without using weapons or magic. They utilize a form
of unarmed combat as part of their mystical
training. They call this training "the discipline,"
but others often call it "martial arts." The discipline involves physical training, meditation,
philosophy, and comprehension of the forces of
the universe, and mystics are taught to resolve
difficult situations peacefully whenever possible;
for these reasons, mystics do not care to have
their lifestyles referred to as "martial arts," as the
term suggests that all they do is fight. The mystics' discipline is presumed to integrate and vastly improve upon the bare-handed combat
techniques described in Chapter 8.
As you can see in the Mystic Special Abilities
Table on the next page, mystics can strike more
often than normal humans, elude attacks better
(their enhanced AC), and deal more damage
when fighting barehanded. They can also fight
with weapons, and can use their multiple attacks
per round with melee and thrown weapons (but
not missile weapons).
In addition, when fighting unarmed, they can
often hurt monsters which can ordinarily only be
hit by magical weapons. Though a mystic's
hands are not magical, an experienced mystic
can use them effectively against creatures immune to normal weapons, as shown in the Mystic
Unarmed Attack Equivalents Table.
Mystic Unarmed Attack Equivalents Table
Weapon
Level Equivalent
2 Silver Weapon
5 +1 weapon
8 +2 weapon
11 +3 weapon
14 +4 weapon
16 + 5 weapon
These attacks don't gain the attack or damage
bonuses of their magic-weapon equivalents, but
can hit creatures as if the indicated weapon were
used. For example, a 5th level mystic can hit and
hurt a gargoyle when fighting barehanded.
Set Spear vs. Charge, Fighter Combat Options
Beginning mystics can utilize the fighter's Set
Spear vs. Charge maneuver. They cannot utilize
the Lance Attack maneuver.
At Name (9th) level, they get three of the
Fighter Combat Options (smash, parry, and disarm, but not multiple attacks). The Fighter
Combat Options are detailed under "Combat
Maneuvers" in Chapter 8.
Acrobatics
Some mystics may also possess a special ability
called acrobatics. This specialized ability, while
useful, detracts a mystic from fully focussing on
his combat abilities; this is why acrobatic mystics
have a -20% penalty on all earned experience.
Acrobatics allows a mystic to perform the following actions:
Jumps/Leaps
Tumbles/Flips
Catches (to prevent oneself from falling)
Swings
Balancing
The game effects of this ability are these:
First, the mystic's acrobatics ability includes
every feature of the Acrobatics general skill mentioned in Chapter 5.
Second, with a successful ability check, the
mystic can cross rough, broken terrain at no
modification to his movement rate: He flips over
obstructions, leaps across trenches, handsprings
over low fences, etc. This doesn't affect his longdistance movement rates; it only affects his encounter speed and running speed.
Third, the mystic can cross a line of enemy
warriors without having to go around or break
through it. With a successful ability check, he
can roll between the legs of one opponent, or
handspring over the line, or pole-vault using his
spear, and thus cross a distance equal to his encounter speed's movement rate. He suffers no
AC penalty when he performs this action.
The mystic's chance to perform any of these
actions successfully is calculated this way: Three
times the mystic's Dexterity score plus two times
the mystic's experience level equals the mystic's
percentile chance to perform the action.
Acrobatics Check =
d% roll vs. ([3 * Dex] + [2 x Lvl])
For example, a 3rd level mystic with Dexterity
15 would have a 51% chance to perform an Acrobatics feat.

The DM, if he prefers to make acrobatics an
easier and more commonly useful ability, can decide to use some alternate means to check success. For example, he might have the player roll
1d20 against his Dexterity score, with any roll
equal to or less than the Dexterity score indicating success.
Whatever type of roll he uses, the DM is free
to adjust any individual roll to reflect the difficulty of the action being attempted. Doing a
backflip on the street to entertain a flock of children is much easier than doing one while walking on a wire ten stories in the air; the DM might
wish to improve the mystic's chance to perform
the former task and make the latter task harder.
Thief Abilities
Any mystic can use the following special abilities of thieves as if he were a thief of the same
level: Find Traps, Remove Traps, Move Silently,
Climb Walls, and Hide in Shadows.
Mystic Abilities
Mystics gain the following special abilities as
they progress in experience levels:
2nd Level: Awareness
4th Level: Heal Self
6th Level: Speak with Animals
8th Level: Resistance
10th Level: Speak with Anyone
12th Level: Mind Block
14th Level: Blankout
16th Level: Gentle Touch
Explanations of Mystic Abilities
Awareness: The mystic is only surprised on a
roll of 1 (on 1d6). (Surprise is explained in
Chapter 7.)
Heal Self: The mystic may, once per day, cure
himself of 1 point of damage for each experience
level he has. He does this simply by concentrating for 1 round. Example: a 10th level mystic can
concentrate for one round and will heal (regain)
10 hit points of damage.
Speak with Animals: The mystic may speak
with any normal or giant animal as often as desired; animals understand his speech and he understands theirs, though no animal is forced to
talk to him.
Resistance: The mystic takes only half damage
(round down) from all spells and breath weapons that inflict damage, or one-quarter damage
(round down) if the saving throw is successful.
Any attack that does him damage will do a minimum of 1 point of damage, even if rounding indicates 0 points of damage.
Speak with Anyone: The mystic may speak
with any living creature that has a language of
any sort, as often as desired. The creature being
spoken to does not have to converse with him.
Mind Block: The mystic is immune to ESP,
hold and slow spells, magical charms, quests,
and geas spells.
Blankout: By concentrating for 1 round, the
mystic causes his presence to "disappear." No
living or undead creature can see him; there is no
saving throw. The effect lasts for 1 round per
level of the mystic; it is dispelled automatically if
he attacks. He may only do this once per day.

Gentle Touch
* The mystic receives the Fighter Combat Options (not including multiple attacks); see the description of them under "Combat Maneuvers" in Chapter 8. The mystic can use these Combat
Options with weapons or in unarmed fighting.
Gentle Touch: Once per day, the mystic may
use the Gentle Touch on any one living creature
(it requires a normal roll to hit; if he fails to hit,
he can try the Gentle Touch again). The mystic
must declare he is using the Gentle Touch before
he rolls to hit, and must declare which result (explained below) he is seeking. The victim does
not get a saving throw, but a victim which has
more Hit Dice than the mystic's experience level
is not affected.
The Touch will have one of the following results (the mystic decides and announces which
before he rolls to hit): charm, cureall, death,
quest, or paralysis. These effects mimic the same
effects of the following spells in all respects except duration: charm person, cureall, death
spell, quest, and hold person. The effect lasts for
24 hours—except for death, which is a permanent effect.
Special Restrictions
Mystics may not use protective magical devices
(such as rings, cloaks, etc.).
All the material goods (money, magical items,
etc.) won, purchased, or acquired as treasure by
the mystic are actually owned by his cloister, not
by the mystic himself. Should the cloister have
need of something "owned" by a mystic, the
head of the cloister need only ask for it.
Higher Experience Levels
A mystic of Name (9th) level is addressed as
master (if male) or mistress (if female).
There are many mystics of 1st to 9th level, but
only seven each of 10th to 12th level, five each of
13th to 15th level, and three of 16th level.
When the character gains enough experience
points to reach 10th level, he must find and
challenge one of the seven 10th level mystics;
they will fight bare-handed (weapons are not allowed). If the player character loses, he stays at
9th level, losing enough experience points that
he is 1 experience point short of 10th level. Once
he's regained 10th level, he may try again, but
cannot issue another challenge until three
months have passed since his first challenge.
(Note: If a DM's campaign world is particularly
large, he might declare that there are seven 10th
and so forth per continent in his world.)
At Name level, the mystic may desire to build
a stronghold, or cloister. If his Grand Abbot
(i.e., the mystic in charge of his current cloister)
agrees that he is fit to manage one, the cloister
will pay for construction of the new cloister. The
new cloister remains a branch of the old one until the PC achieves 13th level, at which time the
PC is called a Greater Master and can declare independence. At that point, he may wish to teach
his mystics-in-training in techniques and philosophies different from those of the other
cloister—that is, he may wish to establish his
own "school" of the discipline.

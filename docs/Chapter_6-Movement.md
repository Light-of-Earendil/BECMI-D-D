bis chapter covers all the information needed for movement in the D&D® world. Using the rules that follow for time; movement;
and travel by land, water, and air will help add
realism to the game.
Time
Time is handled somewhat differently in the
D&D game than it is in real life. Time that the
players experience is called "real time." Time
that the characters experience is "game time." In
D&D games, the passage of time experienced by
the characters is usually compressed. A game can
take as little as an hour of real time or up to
twelve hours (or even longer with tireless players), but that real time may represent days or
weeks of game time.
Game time is not always longer than actual
real time. Combat and some role-playing can
take much longer than the actual game time. For
example, it may take half an hour of real time to
play a battle that lasts only a few minutes of
game time.
Rounds, Turns, and Days
Game time is divided into rounds, turns, and
days, as described in the following text.
Rounds: Situations of immediate danger—
such as combat or those precarious seconds when
a character trips a trap, falls into a pit, grabs hold
of the side, and gazes down in terror at the
poison-tipped spikes far below—are normally
measured in rounds, each of which represents 10
seconds of game time. Except when the rules
specify otherwise, each character can perform
only one action during a round—swing a sword,
cast a spell, or perform some movement or other
action.
Turns: Slightly less intense situations—such as
carefully exploring a dangerous set of catacombs,
sneaking up on an enemy encampment, or trying to escape a pursuing army that is a mile or
more behind—are usually measured in turns,
each of which represents 10 minutes of game
time. In the course of a turn, should something
happen to propel the character into an immediately dangerous situation, the DM will always
shift the time sequence to rounds.
Days: Characters' lives are not all spent in
breakneck action scenes. Sometimes they do
things that take a great deal of time to accomplish, such as journey 1,000 miles on horseback,
do library research, create a golem, or sit around
the city waiting while the king finishes putting
his army together. Typically, the DM passes this
rime in days, describing one or two things the
characters might learn or do each day. Should
one of these events lead to a role-playing encounter, the DM can always shift to turns and
rounds.
See the Measurements of Game Time Table
for more information on how these units interconnect.
Skipped Time
It's also possible to measure longer periods of
time simply by skipping over them. For instance,
characters might finish up one adventure together and decide they need to fulfill their family obligations for awhile. They split up, each
returning to his respective home, and agree to
meet at an inn known to all of them after one
month. The DM will ask each character what
he's doing during this skipped time, give each
character the results of his actions, and then
bring the characters back together again when
the time is up. Great lengths of time, up to
years, can be passed this way if both players and
the DM wish to do so.
Assumed and Defined
Actions
In D&D games, the player does not normally
have to describe every action his character takes
throughout the day. For example, when the
characters are doing long-distance traveling and
time is being measured by the day, it's reasonable for everyone to assume that the characters
do eat, rest after and sometimes during travel,
talk to one another, behave in a normally prudent and careful fashion, and so forth, without
the players having to role-play every single incident or encounter.
Distance
Feet vs. Yards
In dungeons and other indoor settings, the
basic unit of distance measurement is the foot.
Missile and spell ranges are measured in feet; a
character's normal speed is expressed in feet. In
wildernesses, open fields, open city streets, and
other outdoor settings, the basic unit of distance
measurement is the yard. (One yard equals three
feet.) In outdoor settings, it is easier to move
quickly due to more open terrain and better
lighting. Therefore, a character's normal speed
outdoors is expressed in yards.
Example: A character who moves 90' per turn
(normal speed) in a dungeon could move 90
yards (or 180') per turn outdoors.
Missiles and spell ranges are also read as feet in
dungeons and as yards in the wilderness. However, the area affected by a spell (or by flaming
oil, a net, or any other such attack) is not read as
yards; it is always read as feet. Thus, a fireball
spell cast in the wilderness would have a range of
240 yards, but it would still have an area effect of
40 feet in diameter.
Map Scales
You may want to keep maps of the characters'
travels; it's usually a very good idea in traditional
dungeon-based campaigns, and the DM may insist on it. With dungeon or indoor maps, you
use graph paper. Each square on the paper typically represents 10' of distance. With wilderness
or outdoor maps, you use hex paper. Map hex
scales vary widely, but the most commonly used
D&D game scales usually have one hex represent
8 or 24 miles. Always check the map key printed
on maps. In any case, the DM will tell you if he
or she wants you to map in a different scale.
Miniature Figures
Your campaign group might like to use miniature figures to represent all characters and monsters, especially in combat encounters.
Several types of miniature figures are available
from toy and hobby shops worldwide that are
made of metal, plastic, or cardboard; the metal
and plastic ones are suitable for painting. With
so many available, you should be able to find
figures that look very similar to your characters.
The 25mm figurines (a human is about 1" tall)
are well-suited to D&D games.
When you use miniatures to conduct combat,
1" on the table surface represents 10' of distance. If a character can move 30 yards (90') in a
round, you'd move his figure 9" ahead on the
table.
You can use a ruler to measure distances or you
can buy one of many vinyl or plastic playing surfaces that are already gridded into inches. Additionally, you can use watercolor markers to draw
room and situation details on vinyl or plastic surfaces and easily erase them once the combat is
done.
Movement
"Move: 120' (40')" gives the character's rates
of movement. The first number, usually 120', is
the number of feet the character moves per turn
at a very cautious walking pace indoors; outdoors, the unit of measurement is tripled so that
Movement, Missile, and Spell Ranges
Indoors: Normal movement speed, missile
ranges, and spell ranges are measured in feet
(90' means ninety feet indoors).
Outdoors: Normal movement speed, missile ranges, and spell ranges are measured in
yards (120' actually means 120 yards outdoors).
Everywhere: Spell effects are always measured in feet.
Maps and Miniatures
Map Scale: Dungeon maps are usually
done on graph paper, one square representing 10'. Wilderness maps are usually on hex
paper, one hex representing 8, 16, 24, 32,
72, or any other distance in miles.
Using Miniatures: In standard game play
using miniatures, 25mm lead or cardboard
miniatures represent human-scale figures. If
you use 25mm hex paper to regulate movement, one hex represents 10'; if you are not
using a hex-grid, one inch on the table-top or
surface represents 10' (indoors or outdoors).

120' becomes 120 yards per turn. (Outdoor
movement is tripled because of easier terrain,
better lighting, etc.) This first number is often
known as "normal speed."
The second number within parentheses is the
movement rate per round in feet; this number is
often called "encounter speed" and is the number used during combat. Outdoors, the encounter speed would be 40 yards as opposed to
40' in this instance.
Movement is sometimes written as "MV 120'
(40')" or "Movement 120' (40')."
Normal, Encounter, and
Running Speeds
Though the normal speed of 120' per turn
seems very slow, this rate includes many assumed actions—mapping, peeking around corners, resting, and so forth.
During encounters, movement is measured in
encounter speed. Characters move at 1/3 their
normal speed in feet per round. In other words,
if the character's normal speed is 120' per turn,
his encounter speed is 40' per round indoors.
In addition, when characters are running at
full speed (toward or away from an enemy), their
rate is equal to their normal speed in feet per
round (rather than turn) or three times their encounter speed. A character can run at maximum
speed for 30 rounds at most (5 minutes) before
becoming exhausted. (Characters with the optional Endurance skill can maintain this pace for
longer periods of time.) In other words, if a character's normal speed is 120' per turn and his encounter speed is 40' per round, his running
speed is 120' per round indoors.
Exhaustion
An exhausted character must rest for at least
three turns (30 minutes) before running or fighting again. An exhausted character who is forced
to fight without rest is penalized in combat.
Monsters gain a + 2 bonus to their attack rolls to
hit the character (because he is unable to dodge
incoming attacks as effectively), and the character must subtract 2 from all attack damage rolls
(he cannot muster the strength to hit more effectively, but any successful hit will still inflict at
least 1 point of damage).
A character who becomes exhausted but is
forced to continue running cannot use his maximum running speed. He drops to encounter
speed and cannot move any faster until he has
rested.
Character Movement Rates
Any character will have a movement rate of
"120' (40')" unless he is weighed down by a lot
of gear. The weight and clumsiness of gear is
called encumbrance and is measured in "cn,"
which are coin-weight equivalents; 1 coin equals
approximately 1/10 of a pound in weight and
awkwardness. The amount of encumbrance the
character carries determines how fast he can
move, as noted in the Character Movement
Rates and Encumbrance Table.
Example: A character carrying 60 lbs. (600 cn)
of armor and equipment will be slowed to a MV
of 90' (30'). Traveling in a dungeon, at a very
cautious walking pace (normal speed), he'll
move 90' per turn; outdoors, walking cautiously
(normal speed) but over easier terrain, he'll walk
90 yards per turn.
Important Note: Groups of characters, if they
intend to stay together, move at the rate of the
slowest character.
Monster Movement Rates
Monsters' and animals' movement rates are
also expressed in the "120' (40')" format. Some
monsters move much faster than player characters, but others are the same speed or slower. See
Chapter 14 for the movement rates of various
monsters.
The only time monster encumbrance is tallied
is when the monster or animal is carrying away
some heavy prey or is being used to carry riders.
Guidelines are found in Chapter 14.
These rules are somewhat simpler than those
for player character encumbrance. For instance,
a monster will be able to move at its full movement rate up to a certain amount of encumbrance carried. It will move at half its movement
rate up to twice that amount of encumbrance
carried, and it will not be able to move at greater
than a certain amount of encumbrance.
Land Travel
This section discusses moving over land using
various movement rates, the effect terrain has on
movement, long-distance travel, becoming lost,
and finding food in the wilds.
Overland Movement Rates
To find the distance a party travels in a day,
find the normal speed of the slowest party member or mount (if all party members are mounted). Divide that speed by 5. The result is the
number of miles per day the party moves
through clear terrain (open fields and range, city,
etc.). This number, of course, is modified if terCharacter Movement Rates and Encumbrance Table

three horses are exhausted, but all are alive. If a rider does not intend to kill or exhaust his horse,
he should use the travel rates listed for the war horse instead.

rain is less favorable.
Terrain (the features of the land being explored) affects the rate of travel. Though it
makes no difference to the combat round or the
10-minute turn, the terrain may affect the distance a party travels in a day, as outlined in the
Terrain Effects on Movement Table.
On the Terrain Effects on Movement Table,
modifiers are not cumulative. When two or more
conditions are in effect (not counting trail/
road), simply use the worst condition to determine the party's movement. When the
characters' path will carry them through several
different types of terrain in a single day, the DM
should decide which one terrain type dominates
and base their movement on that type of terrain.
For convenience's sake, character and mount
movement in the most common types of terrain
are listed in the Traveling Rates by Terrain Table.
Find out which party member moves slowest on
this table; his movement rate will dictate the
movement for the entire party.
Long-Distance Travel and Rest
Characters and mounts must rest one full day
for every six days they spend traveling. Those
who do not rest suffer a — 1 penalty on attack
rolls and damage rolls until they do rest. If they
go more than six days without resting, they suffer an additional - 1 penalty per six days until
they do rest, and they must rest one full day for
each six days they spent traveling if they are to
lose the penalty.
Becoming Lost
A party following a road, trail, or river or led
by a reliable guide will not become lost. A guide
is a retainer who knows the local area or—if you
are using the optional general skills rules—is a
PC or an NPC who has either the Navigation or
Knowledge (of the area in question) skill. The
DM may require the character to make his
Navigation/Knowledge skill check each day to
keep the party on track.
However, if a party is not on a road, trail, or
river and does not have a guide, the party may
become lost. The DM must check each day to see
if the adventurers become lost by rolling 1d6 before the party begins movement for the day. Find
the type of terrain the party is traveling through
on the following list; if the roll on the die
matches the number listed, the party becomes
lost.
• Clear or grasslands: 1.
• Swamp, jungle, or desert: 1-3.
• All other terrain: 1-2.
If a party is lost, find the direction of travel
(either by the DM's choice or by random roll).
The DM must keep track of the party's actual position and the direction the characters think they
are going! For example, the party members tell
the DM that they want to travel north. However,
the DM has secretly determined that the party is
lost and that northeast is the direction the party
thinks is north. If the group travels this direction
and then decides to travel in a different direction, the DM will have to adjust accordingly. For
example, after traveling "north" for six miles
(although actually traveling northeast), the
group decides to turn northwest; the members
will actually be going north at this point.
Food in the Wild
Traveling characters sometimes run out of
food in the wild. Cautious parties bring enough
standard or iron rations for everyone's use for the
whole trip plus up to 50% extra; but great delays
(weather, magical traps, other problems) can still
cause them to run out of food. However, in most
terrain types (but not in some swamps or
oceans), parties may either forage or hunt to get
more food.
The characters may forage while traveling, but
they slow their daily movement rate to 2/3 normal as a result. (They cannot forage while on a
forced march.) Foraged food includes nuts, berries, some plants, and possibly small game. In
good terrain and weather, characters usually
have a 50% chance (1-3 on 1d6) of finding
enough food to survive. The DM may modify
this due to the terrain, and he or she will make
all the necessary rolls.
If the characters spend a full day in the vicinity
of their camp, normal foraging is automatically
successful. Such characters might (DM's choice)
encounter animals that they can hunt for additional food. Days spent in a forced march or resting cannot be spent hunting.
If the campaign is using the general skills from
Chapter 5, a character with the Hunting skill forages automatically (without movement penalties) in fertile areas, even when on the move, and
he uses his Hunting skill roll to determine how
successful he is during days spent in search of
game.
If characters run out of food, they will become
ravaged by hunger. They will need to rest more,
travel slower, suffer attack roll penalties and
gradual loss of hit points, and eventually face
death from starvation.
Water Travel
Characters are sometimes forced to swim or
use ships to reach destinations via waterways.
This section describes how to do both.
By Swimming (and
Drowning)
In the D&D® game, all characters may swim
unless the DM decides otherwise. A character's
movement rate while swimming is 1/5 his outdoor running speed (120 yards per round H/ 5 =
24 yards per round). A character swimming
underwater always measures his movement rate
in feet. Thus, a character who can swim at 24
yards per round on the surface can swim at 24
feet per round underwater.
Under normal conditions, a swimming character is in no danger of drowning. However, if the
character is swimming while carrying heavy encumbrance or swimming in rough, dangerous
conditions, he can drown. If a character is carrying more than 400 cn encumbrance, sheer
weight will drag him down. The DM should decide on the chances of drowning in rough water,
swimming while encumbered, or fighting while
swimming.
Generally, if the DM wishes, he can tell the
player to make an appropriate ability check each
round (for example, a Strength check if the character is battling high seas or a Constitution check
against exhaustion) to check on the character's
ability to keep his head above water. On the first
occasion the character misses his ability check, he
slips under the water.
When a character goes underwater—and cannot breathe there—he must hold his breath or
immediately begin drowning. He can hold his
breath for a number of rounds equal to his Constitution score if he does not exert himself; if he
exerts himself (by fighting, panicking, etc.) he
can only hold his breath for a number of rounds
equal to half his Constitution score.
Once a character can no longer hold his
breath, he begins to drown. He must make a
Constitution check every round. The first check
is against his normal Constitution score; each
subsequent one is rolled with a cumulative + 1
penalty to the die roll ( + 1 on the second check,
+ 2 on the third, etc.).
Once he fails a check, he has drowned—but
he is not dead yet. Although he doesn't breathe,
he will not be dead for a number of rounds equal
to 1/3 his Constitution score (round up). While
he is in this state halfway between life and
death, if he can be healed by a character with the
Healing skill or by a character with healing magic, he will recover normally.
If this happy event does not take place, the
character dies. However, he still may be brought
back to life by a raise dead spell.
A character who reaches the stage at which he
is making Constitution rolls to keep from drowning, even if he is rescued and does not drown, is
considered exhausted, as described above under
"Exhaustion."
By Ship
For waterborne traveling, whether on a river
or near a coast, characters move at the ship's rate.
The ship's movement rate given on the Sailing
Vessels Table in Chapter 4 is for average sailing
conditions. If the voyage is favored by steady
winds and calm waters, the speed may be increased to as much as double the number given.
If the seas are rough or the vessel becalmed, little
or no progress might be made in a day!
When sailing on seas or oceans, there is a
chance that the weather will be unsuitable for
travel. Roll 2d6 at the beginning of each day; a
result of 2 indicates no wind and a roll of 12 indicates gales or fierce storms. The effects such
weather has on ship travel are as follows:
No Wind: Sailing ships (vessels without rowers) may not move and must spend the entire
day in the same area (hex). Rowed ships are never stopped for lack of wind; they are unaffected
by calm weather.
Gale or Storm: Results differ whether the ship
is a sailing ship or a galley, as noted in the following:
• Sailing Ship: This type of ship may either
sit (80% chance of sinking) or run before the
wind. Movement rate is triple normal, but it is in
a random direction as determined by the DM.
(The DM can see the Water Movement Modification Table for a handy direction generator if he
or she wishes.) If no coastline is reached during
(triple) one day's movement, the maneuver is
successful and the ship is safe (though likely to
be far off course). If the ship reaches a coastline
or other shore, there is a 75% chance that it will
be broken up trying to beach, and only a 25%
chance that it will safely find a sheltering harbor.
(DMs can modify that chance if they are using
the optional general skills. If the ship's pilot can
make his Piloting skill check, the ship's chances
of finding safety improve by 5 % for every point
by which he successfully makes his roll.)
• Galley (Lifeboat, Raft): Any vessel without
sails has only a 20% chance of weathering a gale;
failure results in the ship being swamped. If the
galley is in sight of the coastline when the gale
first hits, check the coastal terrain. If it is clear
terrain, the galley may beach before the storm
hits. For all other terrain, roll 1d6; a result of 1-2
indicates that the pilot finds a safe beach or cove.
(As noted under sailing ship above, a good pilot
can improve the galley's chances if the DM is using the general skills rules and the pilot can
make his Piloting skill check. Historically, many
galleys did have sails, but the galleys found in
the D&D® game do not.)
If a DM prefers to add more complexity to his
game world, he can add some optional water
movement rules for traveling by water. Roll 2d6
at the start of each day traveled by water and
check the results on the Optional Water Movement Modification Table.
Aerial Travel
Characters traveling on aerial mounts can
move 72 miles per day. Characters traveling on
aerial devices (such as flying carpets) can move
120 miles per day.
